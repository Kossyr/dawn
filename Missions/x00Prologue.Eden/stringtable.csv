STRM_x00v10,"You are listening to Le Marquis radio station. This morning is one of the most imporatant dates of the old and noble republic of Everon.\nWe experienced a major outrage during the last presidential elections\nwhich were won by a populist right-wing candidate Edouard Daladier\nwho defeated the old time favourite Philippe Petain with the difference of one vote.","",radio
STRM_x00v11,"It was very heated in the parliament during the inaguration ceremony.\nAnd it was boiling after Edouard Daladier presented his new goverment policies\nwhich would transfer most if not all responsibilities from parliament to the office of the president.\nMost senior politicans called him a fascist dictator and had to be escorted from the building.","",radio
STRM_x00v12,"His reforms unpopular, he faced three no-confidence votes which he survived with the support of his party and a few liberal turncoats.\nTensions grew as his bill finally passed the lower house and was close to being ratified.\nThe liberal party disputed the validity of the process and declared they would no longer take part in the parliament\n and walked out the same day.","",radio
STRM_x00v13,"Supporters of both sides clashed in the street and even the militia couldn't keep the peace.\nAfter the latest riots in Lamentin the president declared national emergency.\nHe asked the militia for support which he requires if he wishes to push his bill through the upper house during an emergency.\nGaston Astier, the general of the militia, refused to do so and was labelled as a traitor by Daladier.","",radio
STRM_x00v14,"With the political instability, unrest in the streets, opposition of the army and the inability of the government to function, \nwe are standing on the verge of a civil war.\nYesterday, Daladier agreed to meet with Astier in an effort to de-escalate the conflict.\nAt the moment these two men hold the most power on the island and their meeting could shape the future of the republic of Everon.","",radio
STRM_x00v15,"Our correspondent is present at this meeting taking place in Montignac, the capital city, and will be giving us the latest information.\nStay tuned to Le Marquis radio, the only news radio outlet in the archipelago.\nAnd may God be with us.","",radio

STRM_x00v16,"There he is, Gaston. You ready?","",Jean
STRM_x00v17,"Let's get this over with. You got my back?","",Gaston

STRM_x00v19,"Good morning, Mr Daladier.","",Astier
STRM_x00v20,"Greetings, Gaston Astier. It is good to see you.","",Daladier
STRM_x00v21,"Can't say I feel the same.","",Astier
STRM_x00v22,"Why the hostility?","",Daladier
STRM_x00v23,"I am this close to commanding my militia to arrest you.","",Astier
STRM_x00v24,"That would be unfortunate as my men would resist you. You would plunge our island into a civil strife.","",Daladier
STRM_x00v25,"Better a civil war than a dictatorship.","",Astier
STRM_x00v26,"You are willing to go far, I can see that. What do you propose then?","",Daladier
STRM_x00v27,"Give up power. Confess you manipulated the elections. Walk away and let us return to peace again.","",Astier
STRM_x00v28,"You do not seem to understand, I was elected by a democratic process. There was no falsifying, fraud or disinformation.\nI convinced people that we needed change.\nThe armies of both superpowers are on our borders and only a strong leader can deter them from turning our island a battleground again.\nAnd strong leader can't be held back by old men in parliament and naysayers.","",Daladier
STRM_x00v29,"If this is truly your vision for our republic then we have nothing more to discuss.\nReady your men because I will come for you tomorrow.","",Astier
STRM_x00v30,"I expected you would see things this way. Luckily I made arrangements. I will not let you destroy everything we built here!","",Daladier

STRM_x00v31,"Do you hear that?","",fisherman
STRM_x00v32,"Yeah. Did we miss the announcement about a plane day again?","",lighthouse keeper
STRM_x00v33,"Look! Over the sea!","",fisherman

STRM_x00v34,"You sold us out?! To the Americans?!","",Astier
STRM_x00v35,"It's either that or the Soviets. You must see it too!","",Daladier
STRM_x00v36,"Coward. We are free people not slaves to some grand masters beyond the sea!","",Astier
STRM_x00v37,"You and your backwards thinking are done, Astier. Come! Arrest that man!","",Daladier

STRM_x00v38,"Hey you! Stop!","",American

STRM_x00v39,"Gaston, quickly get in!","",Jean
STRM_x00v40,"Thank you, Jean. You might have saved my life.","",Astier
