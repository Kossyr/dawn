STRM_f04v01,"Prisoner Grigory Lemontov, you have a visitor. I'm to take you to the base.",Guard
STRM_f04v02,"Follow me.",Guard
STRM_f04v03,"Go inside and take a seat, your visitor will be here shortly.",Guard
STRM_f04v04,"Hello, Mr Lemontov.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v05,"It has been a while. How are you?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v06,"They told me you do not speak too much, but I would expect at least a simple 'Hello'.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v07,"I can only imagine how you are feeling. Believe me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v08,"This is not one would imagine the menace of the east - sitting silently, without motion, defeated. It seems you have given up.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v09,"Is this how you see the next fourteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v10,"Have you come to mock me?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v11,"Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v12,"I lost everything that was ever dear to me. I was forced to kill my own brother, betraying my comrades and my country.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v13,"Branded as a traitor by my people and a murderer by you, your company is the very last thing I require.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v14,"I see you're full of anger and hatred. Your guilt is dragging you down and it makes the world seem bleak.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v15,"You will get over it, I can promise you that. The pain will recede and you will heal - all in due time.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v16,"Speaking from experience?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v17,"We are from the same cloth, Mr Lemontov. If anyone can understand you, it's only someone like you.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v18,"We are nothing alike.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v19,"More than you might realize.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v20,"Did you have to destroy the only thing that made sense in your life? Did you have to betray everything you were taught to believe from birth?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v21,"No, you know nothing about me. I told you people I wanted to be left alone.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v22,"I understand, Mr Lemontov. Left alone you shall be - for a time.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v23,"Guards! We're done!",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v24,"You will not get rid of me that easily. I'll be back.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v25,"Don't bother.",Lemontov


STRM_f04v26,"Hello, Mr Lemontov.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v27,"Is this going to be a yearly oocassion?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v28,"I am fairly busy, otherwise I would have come sooner.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v29,"I would actually prefer less frequency or never at all.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v30,"I brought you a few photographs. Take a gander, I think you might find them interesting.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v31,"Where did you find these?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v32,"In a hidden stash on Kolguyev. You were aware there was a photographer on the island?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v33,"Yes. Before the war started, these photos were taken for some posters back home.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v34,"They're from the day you attacked Everon, aren't they?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v35,"Yes. I still remember it like it was yesterday.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v36,"The last two are the most interesting.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v37,"You can keep the photos, I have copies. Did you see the weapon?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v38,"Kind of hard to miss.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v39,"It shows that Livanokh was going to use the weapon from the very beginning and you were not aware of it.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v40,"We trusted each other all our lives. We fought together for years, side by side. I cannot believe he tried to do this behind my back.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v41,"Why do you think is that?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v42,"He probably realized I would be against it. It was an insane plan, absolutely out of the question.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v43,"I would try to reason with him. If that wouldn't work, then I would try to stop him.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v44,"He did not tell me to avoid that. He knew me too well.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v45,"I should have realized. If only I wasn't so blind...",Lemontov
STRM_f04v46,"You should not blame yourself.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v47,"Who else am I to blame? I am aware of what I've done. I realized in the very end my errors, but it's my fault that it came to that in the first place.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v48,"Nobody could have predicted the extent of Livanokh's rage, not even you.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v49,"I was a direct part of it. No matter what I thought, I helped him almost achieve his goal.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v50,"Almost is an important word.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v51,"I need time to think.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v52,"Of course, you have all the time in the world.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v53,"Think carefully and find it in you to forgive yourself. I'll be back, Mr Lemontov.",Dyaconsen


STRM_f04v54,"Mr Dyaconsen.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v55,"Hello, Mr Lemontov. That's a first.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v56,"I had a question for you.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v57,"Ask away.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v58,"I want to know about Rashiv. Did he contact you first?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v59,"Rashiv's involvement is officially a top level classified information. Then again, you know most of it anyways.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v60,"We received strange signals way before your invasion of Everon. We weren't quite sure what they meant at first.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v61,"On Malden, the signals became more frequent and we managed to decipher the message they were carrying - coordinations to a location on Everon.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v62,"The command centre.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v63,"Yes. We conducted a raid. With all the information about your troops and battle plans we obtained, we managed to push you back on Malden.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v64,"The signals kept coming in. Later, we eventually met personally with Rashiv on Everon.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v65,"When you came to the base, after the shooting - was he still alive?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v66,"No one was breathing by the time we got there, Rashiv among them.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v67,"My greatest mistake. He actually knew what Livanokh was planning or at least suspected it.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v68,"He tried to warn me once but I did not listen. He should have told me outright.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v69,"Would you have believed him?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v70,"No. I guess I had to see it with my own eyes to realize the truth. I had to hear it from Alexander himself.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v71,"Why did people have to die before that though? I was so stupid.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v72,"Making mistakes is part of our lives. You make progress by learning from them.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v73,"What you did and didn't do is in the past now, Mr Lemontov. Learn from it and look towards your future.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v74,"Certainly, the remaining twelve years between four wooden walls and a hole in the wall.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v75,"Your confinement is something I can try to improve. It might take a while though.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v76,"The most important stuff is in your head. Stop blaming yourself for things outside of your control.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v77,"Realize that you saved the entire world. Realize that you are a hero and not a villain.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v78,"I... I understand what you're doing, Mr Dyaconsen.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v79,"Good. I hope I can finally say that we are both on the same page.",Dyaconsen


STRM_f04v80,"Hello, Mr Dyaconsen.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v81,"Greetings, Mr Lemontov. Beautiful day, isn't it? We're going to go on a little walk.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v82,"Is that allowed?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v83,"You've been here for four years without an incident. A good behaviour if I do say so myself. From now on, you can go around the western part of the island without any difficulties.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v84,"Guards will shadow you, of course. But this time, they shall keep their distance, right boys?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v85,"Yes, sir!",Guard
STRM_f04v86,"Come, Mr Lemontov.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v87,"Malden is a little bit barren, isn't it? The local fauna can't quite compare to your thick forests of Kolguyev.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v88,"I hated it at first, but the island does grow on you. It has a peculiar image that is quite unique to it.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v89,"I couldn't agree more.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v90,"Now that we're away from prying eyes, we can talk freely. There is an important matter that you must learn.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v91,"The events at the villa - what truly happened that night - we are the only two people who know the truth.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v92,"What?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v93,"The official version is that Livanohk did not surrender and fought back. I had to defend myself and had to shoot.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v94,"Why?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v95,"Because you asked me to.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v96,"I did but I did not expect you to keep your word. I mean, what's in it for you?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v97,"It is helpful to you and that is important. You will not spend the rest of your life here, Mr Lemontov - one day you'll be free and you'll be allowed to return to your homeland.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v98,"Livanokh had friends - possibly at high places. Someone enabled him to get a nuclear warhead on the island. Someone had to operate it. Someone had to prepare it.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v99,"Whoever they were, they had to know what they were doing and why - so there is still someone out there who knows of Livanokh's plan.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v100,"Someone who wouldn't mind seeing it through. It is imperative they don't know of your actions in the villa - they should not have a reason to go after you and it gives you more breathing room.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v101,"I'm impressed you thought this far into the future.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v102,"You said it yourself - 'Don't tell the truth. You will make both our lives easier'. It is irony though that your reward is a prison cell while I received medals for something I have not done.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v103,"You'll manage, I'm sure. Thank you for trusting me, Mr Dyaconsen.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v104,"I thank you, Mr Lemontov, every year for saving us all.",Dyaconsen


STRM_f04v105,"Don't you think we are past the 'Mr' part by now?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v106,"Coming from you, it is very surprising but welcoming. All right, let's shake hands to it, Lemontov!",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v107,"I jest. I appreciate you feel this way and I'll gladly call you Grigory from now on.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v108,"Likewise, George, likewise.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v109,"Now, how do you feel, Grigory?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v110,"I think, George, that I'm... better. I still feel heavy thinking about that night and what I've done.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v111,"I don't think that feeling will ever go away. But I think I learned to accept it and am able to finally move past it.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v112,"That is very good to hear. You were in a bad spot the last couple of years.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v113,"I know. My world got turned upside down. It felt like everything lost its meaning. It helped me that you came in and talked. More than I care to admit.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v114,"I've heard you've been spending most of your time outside now.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v115,"Indeed, few times even slept under the stars. It is exactly what I needed and I think I have you to thank for that.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v116,"Stop with the thanks already, otherwise I'm going to think you actually lost your mind.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v117,"There's another thanks incoming - for the library.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v118,"You read through all the books?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v119,"There's not much you can do on this island - I could draw you a map to every bush, tree stump or a hole in the ground. On the western part.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v120,"There are hangars to the east - you never wanted to talk about it - why?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v121,"I cannot divulge that information. I already had to curry favours from a number of people to get you all this.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v122,"Eastern part is off limits, Grigory, and that is not going to change.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v123,"All right, you are risking I'll become so bored I might try to swim home.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v124,"That won't be necessary. I'll find you something to do, then, don't you worry.",Dyaconsen


STRM_f04v125,"Welcome, sir!",Guard
STRM_f04v126,"How's he doing?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v127,"Beaten most of our records, the bastard. A great idea from your side, sir!",Guard
STRM_f04v128,"What a devil.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v129,"Time?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v130,"Twenty nine point five seconds.",Guard
STRM_f04v131,"Not bad, can I try one more?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v132,"Grigory, take a break, will you? You're dragging my men's dignity through the mud.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v133,"Not my fault you failed to train them properly, George! It's good to see you.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v134,"It's good to see you as well. You look great.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v135,"I feel great. I haven't even realized how much I was missing this. Care for a little race?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v136,"I wouldn't want to embarrass you. I'm also here only for an hour, I have to get back soon.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v137,"Is something the matter?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v138,"There's always something, Grigory. Let us step out for a moment.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v139,"If you're just dropping by that means you have business in the area.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v140,"I certainly do. Unfortunately, it's not something I'm looking forward to.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v141,"Does it have anything to do with my people?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v142,"Not at all, your people are all happy on their little island.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v143,"Kolguyev is still Russian?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v144,"Yes, although I was not supposed to tell you that. It was returned to your country shortly after the war.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v145,"You used to joke about swimming back home and didn't even realize how feasible it actually was.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v146,"Don't think about it, though. You wouldn't get far.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v147,"I sometimes forget we are still enemies.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v148,"If you want to call us that.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v149,"George, I am imprisoned by you with orders to shoot if I misbehave. Once I'm released, I can be sent back here with you as my target.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v150,"We will end up on opposing sides no matter how you look at it.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v151,"We are not going to end up, Grigory, we already are. And we never stopped being.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v152,"Why did you help me so much then?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v153,"Was I supposed to let you rot here?",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v154,"Yes.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v155,"Maybe I was, but I am the only one who knows your true actions and I bear responsibility for your return so you can finish what you started.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v156,"What are you actually thinking will happen?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v157,"I do believe you are able to change things. Call it a gut feeling if you will. I never believed your path would end in this prison, on the contrary - your greatest feats are still before you.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v158,"Major Dyaconsen, sir, your presence is required.",Guard
STRM_f04v159,"I'm coming, private, I'll be right there.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v160,"I'll be back, Grigory, keep up the training! You are going to need it!",Dyaconsen


STRM_f04v161,"I have great news for you, Grigory.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v162,"Is that why you refused to say anything on our way here?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v163,"You need to sit down for this. Grigory, you are getting out of here.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v164,"What?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v165,"You are about to walk out a free man - in three days.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v166,"What do you mean, George, what happened?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v167,"A prisoner swap has been agreed - you for our three important people. There is an exchange in three days on Kolguyev.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v168,"It's over, Grigory, you're going home.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v169,"Seven years... only halfway through...",Lemontov
STRM_f04v170,"You served your sentence, it is time for you to go - you are needed elsewhere.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v171,"Sorry I couldn't tell you before, it was a long time in the making. On the morning three days from now, we're taking you to your island.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v172,"This is the best news you could have brought, George. Finally, freedom!",Lemontov
STRM_f04v173,"Didn't think it would end so abruptly, so unexpectedly... is there anything I'm supposed to do in the meantime?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v174,"No, no, nothing at all. Everything's being taken care of. I was hoping we would spend the last days by conducting a raid on the local liquor supplies.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v175,"A daring plan, George, I'm all for it.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v176,"Let's go. Leave all those years behind you and welcome the new beginning.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v177,"After you.",Lemontov


STRM_f04v178,"I am ready to go, George.",Lemontov
STRM_f04v179,"Grigory, before we go... I need to tell you something...",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v180,"There will be a time - and I am certain of it - there will be a time when we meet again.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v181,"I want to say it now - I am sorry.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v182,"What are you apologizing for?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v183,"I did not agree with it and I was against it. Remember that, Grigory. I hope you will forgive me.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v184,"George, what are you talking about?",Lemontov
STRM_f04v185,"When you learn it you will understand. I hope... I do hope you do not forget our friendship.",Dyaconsen
STRM_f04v186,"Sir, we need to move, we're on a clock!",Guard
STRM_f04v187,"Come, Grigory, it is time for you to go home.",Dyaconsen
