They cannot break the Russian bear. A total war is inevitable.
Ambition and iron will are going to determine the victor.
It is our turn to rewrite history.
Russian speaking, you say? That is bound to be an interesting story. Bring him to me.
We are not the bad guys here. It is a battle of different views of the world and you happen to find yourself in the middle of it.
Malden is falling, we are close, Sasha!
Not close enough! Push harder! Time is not on our side!
We lost because...
Because there are traitors in our ranks! Find them and weed them out! My plan can still work...
Where have you been last night? Where have you and Rashiv been?
I hate traitors, comrade Rashiv. Kill them all.
A trap will be sprung and the world will yet know of us, Grigory. Leave it to me.
It's over, Livanokh! I am taking you in.
I have not shown all my hand! Behold!
Stop it! No!

Murderer...
Soviet dog...
Traitor...
Kinslayer...
Fratricide...
Coward...
Betrayer...
Killer...
Slayer...
Liar...
Deceiver...
Lemontov...
Lemontov!


Hey, Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Russian bear cannot be broken. A total war is inevitable.
Our ambition and iron will are going to carry us to victory.
The world is going to change. We shall usher in a new era bringing an end to selfish individualism and society based purely on money and power.
Stand by my side, Grigory, as we rewrite history.


Remember me?
Sasha!
You still recognize me, old frind? Even after what you did to my visage?
You betrayed me, you betrayed everyone. Your ancestors turn in their graves. You bring shame to all of us.
What you were doing was madness!
I thought you shared my vision. You disappoint me, Grigory. We had a chance to change the world but you refused.
I had to do it. I am sorry, Sasha, you had to be stopped.
You reap what you sow. You will slowly wither away into oblivion, forgotten, imprisoned by our greatest foe.
Stop it...
You are a traitor. You killed your own brother who made you who you are.
You took all the trust and care and spit on it. You disgust me.
Stop...
I pronounce you guilty, Grigory Lemontov, and I sentence you to death!

What the fuck are these nightmares? Will they ever stop?

Is he inside?
As always.
Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; year 1 1981

Take a seat. Your visitor will be here shortly.


Hello, Mr Lemontov.
It has been a while. How are you?
They told me you do not speak too much, but I would expect at least a simple 'Hello'.
I can only imagine how you are feeling. Belive me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.
This is not one would imagine the menace of the east - sitting silently, without motion, defeted. It seems you have given up.
Is this how you see the next fifteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.
Have you come to mock me?
Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.
I lost everything that was ever dear to me. I was forced to kill my own brother, betraying my comrades and my country.
I had to do what was necessary to avert catastrophe even if it was the hardest thing I have ever done.
Branded as a traitor by my people and a murderer by you, I would rather be dead than to suffer this shame any longer.
I see you're full of anger, despair and hatred. Your guilt is dragging you down and it makes the world seem bleak.
You will get over it, I can promise you that. The pain will recede and you will heal - all in due time.
Speaking from experience?
We are from the same cloth, Mr Lemontov. If anyone can understand you, it's only someone like you.
We are nothing alike.
More than you might realize.
Did you have to destroy the only thing that made sense in your life? Did you have to betray everything you were taught to believe from birth?
No, you know nothing about me. I told you people I wanted to be left alone.
And we obliged. Although you would do well to see a doctor, given your state.
I am fine.
We both know that's not true. You can't be after what happened.
I saved the world. Isn't that enough for you to leave me be?
I would if I didn't care. This shouldn't be the end of Grigory Lemontov, should it?
You are on a suicide watch. Men are betting how long you are gonna last, the longest guess being three years.
You refuse to eat and drink very little. You don't sleep at night, you don't comunicate, you lost weight. You are a shadow of your former self.
And your point is?
Get it together, Mr Lemontov, don't give up yet. 
I have nothing left to live for and your empty words are not going to change that.
This visit is over. Guards, I want to go back to my cell!
Don't bother visiting again, Mr Dyaconsen. Don't waste your time on me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where did you get this?
In one of tents on Kolguyev. Livanokh's personal stash perhaps?
This is from the day you attacked Everon, isn't it?
Yes. I still remember it like it was just yesterday.
And it's already been a year. Have a look at the others as well.
The next one is my personal favourite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How's Lemontov's cell construction coming along?
It was postponed due to...
Prioritize it. The man deserves at least a fucking view.
Yes, sir!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I don't need doctors to tell me you are in a bad spot. Is this the fate you imagine for yourself? Dying in a western prison?
Don't let this be the end. Get it together, Mr Lemontov, and rise once more. Don't give up yet.
Are you done? Can I get back to my cell?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter your actions, you always lived with consequences. You never faltered and you proved to be a formidable opponent.

We are both patriots putting the country and its people above all else. We play politics not because we want to, but because we have to.
We make the hard decisions, we lead the men. We take the blame and only sometimes the credit.
We do what is necessary no matter the cost. We have to do things others have not the stomach to even consider.

We do what we must because no one else would. That's why we're sitting across this table right now, Mr Lemontov.
The choices we made led us here. How you decide to proceed is only up to you.
Nice speech, Mr Dyaconsen, but I am stuck here for the foreseeable future in case you didn't notice.
It might take fifteen years, it might take less or more, but you will return outside. And you want to be ready when you do.
Can you... can you tell me anything? About the outside?
No, I am sorry... I can't even if I wanted to.
But I will try to make your stay here more pleasant that much I can promise you.
I... I appreciate it, Mr Dyaconsen.
Do not worry about it, Mr Lemontov. I think the world owes you a debt of gratitude whether the people realize it or not. This is the least I can do.

Our time is up. I have some other business to attend to here. I'll be back, Mr Lemontov, stay safe until then. Or at least try.
Goodbye for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, Fred, big shots came in this morning. They want the Spec Op, in the hangar E.
Hangar E, got it. I'll fetch him.
Take my jeep. See you later.
Hold on, George, are we still up for tonight?
Of course. We've got cards and whiskey taken care of - come before nightfall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't. I already told you all I know. I saved your asses - isn't that enough for you to leave me be?
You barely told us anything. And I did not expect you to - whatever you describe yourself in your head, you are no traitor.
How would you describe killing my commander, my countryman, my brother? Destroying the last chance he had to win the war?
A hero. In spite of all your flaws, you did the right thing in the end. You did not let emotions cloud your judgement. 
You know he had to be stopped. His actions would destroy the world as we know it and millions would die.
It is the rason you're still breathing - prosecution demanded death penalty at first.
Maybe I should have been shot. Would you have done the honours?
Nonsence. You are useless dead, you need to know that.
How useful am I in your prison?
You're alive and that's important. If you wanted to end it so much you could have just attacked the guards. They have orders to shoot if you try anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, I'm here for the prisoner.
You can find him over there. He's sitting in the grass looking over the sea.
You let him?
He's been there like this the whole night. I had to change guards three times. The bastard's got VIP treatment, not much I can do.
After killing so many of us, really? Have you thought about putting a bullet through his head?
If you want to be charged with murder and end your carrier, go right ahead. That piece of shit is not worth it.

Grigory Lemontov, you have a visitor. I'm to take you to the hangars.
Follow me.

Take a seat, your visitor will be here shortly.

I understand, Mr Lemontov. Left alone you shall be - for a time.
We're done!
You will not get rid of me that easily. I'll be back.
Don't bother.

; year 2 1982

Hello, Mr Lemontov.
Is this going to be a yearly thing?
I am fairly busy, otherwise I would have come sooner.
I would prefer less frequency or never at all.
I brought you a few photos. 



I meant to ask you about Alexander Livanokh and your history.
I already told you everything.



Why did Alexander Livanokh not tell you about the weapons?
Another interrogation?
I'm trying to piece the puzzle together. In your own words, you were his most trusted companion, his brother. Why would he keep it away from you?
Perhaps he knew I wouldn't agree.
Weren't you two trying to destroy us?
Beat you on a battlefield, embarass you by forcing you out of Malden - those were our goals. I would never agree to using weapons of mass destruction on civilian population.
Alexander knew me well. 



Last time you told me you were a traitor to your people. Is nuking the USA part of your constitution?
No, but shooting your own is.
It's good then the only people who know what truly happened in that villa are sitting in this very room.
You did not disclose it? Why?
I told you I wouldn't. The official version is that Livanokh resisted arrest and tried to fight. I was forced to defend myself.
The truth is our truth for now.
Why did you do it?
I already told you - you asked me to. But there is one other reason as well.
Alexander Livanokh had friends. Someone had to get the weapons in. Someone had to operate them.
You told us yourself you were not aware of any of it. Therefore, We can be sure that someone is still out there and you would not want them to be aware of your actions.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took you a whole year to get back?
I have things to do, Mr Lemontov. I couldn't have come any sooner and I am sorry for that.
It felt like an eternity. You were right, the cell wall is not that interesting anymore.
It took me close to two years but I am starting to think clearly again.
That is very good to hear, but I have been told that you hit the wall with your head eight times, that there were sixty seven sleepless nights and when you did get sleep you would trash around and scream 'murderer' from the top of your lungs.
Nice of you to keep track.
I'm not a doctor and I understand you did not wish to see any - but are you well, Mr Lemontov? Can I call off the suicide watch?
I have no intention of killing myself, Mr Dyaconsen. Although I did consider it several times. The solitude, the guilt, the uncertainty - it was a lot to take in and I needed time.
Whatever the future holds, I am of no use dead.
