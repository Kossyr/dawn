They cannot break the Russian bear. A total war is inevitable.
Ambition and iron will are going to determine the victor.
It is our turn to rewrite history.
Russian speaking, you say? That is bound to be an interesting story. Bring him to me.
We are not the bad guys here. It is a battle of different views of the world and you happen to find yourself in the middle of it.
Malden is falling, we are close, Sasha!
Not close enough! Push harder! Time is not on our side!
We lost because...
Because there are traitors in our ranks! Find them and weed them out! My plan can still work...
Where have you been last night? Where have you and Rashiv been?
I hate traitors, comrade Rashiv. Kill them all.
A trap will be sprung and the world will yet know of us, Grigory. Leave it to me.
It's over, Livanokh! I am taking you in.
I have not shown all my hand! Behold!
Stop it! No!

Murderer...
Soviet dog...
Traitor...
Kinslayer...
Fratricide...
Coward...
Betrayer...
Killer...
Slayer...
Liar...
Deceiver...
Lemontov...
Lemontov!


Hey, Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Russian bear cannot be broken. A total war is inevitable.
Our ambition and iron will are going to carry us to victory.
The world is going to change. We shall usher in a new era bringing an end to selfish individualism and society based purely on money and power.
Stand by my side, Grigory, as we rewrite history.


Remember me?
Sasha!
You still recognize me, old friend? Even after what you did to my visage?
You betrayed me, you betrayed everyone. Your ancestors turn in their graves. You bring shame to all of us.
What you were doing was madness!
I thought you shared my vision. You disappoint me, Grigory. We had a chance to change the world but you refused.
I had to do it. I am sorry, Sasha, you had to be stopped.
You reap what you sow. You will slowly wither away into oblivion, forgotten, imprisoned by our greatest foe.
Stop it...
You are a traitor. You killed your own brother who made you who you are.
You took all the trust and care and spit on it. You disgust me.
Stop...
I pronounce you guilty, Grigory Lemontov, and I sentence you to death!

What the fuck are these nightmares? Will they ever stop?

Is he inside?
As always.
Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; year 1 1981

Take a seat. Your visitor will be here shortly.


Hello, Mr Lemontov.
It has been a while. How are you?
They told me you do not speak too much, but I would expect at least a simple 'Hello'.
I can only imagine how you are feeling. Beleive me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.
This is not one would imagine the menace of the east - sitting silently, without motion, defeated. It seems you have given up.
Is this how you see the next fifteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.
Have you come to mock me?
Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.
I lost everything that was ever dear to me. I was forced to kill my own brother, betraying my comrades and my country.
I had to do what was necessary to avert catastrophe even if it was the hardest thing I have ever done.
Branded as a traitor by my people and a murderer by you, I would rather be dead than to suffer this shame any longer.
I see you're full of anger, despair and hatred. Your guilt is dragging you down and it makes the world seem bleak.
You will get over it, I can promise you that. The pain will recede and you will heal - all in due time.
Speaking from experience?
We are from the same cloth, Mr Lemontov. If anyone can understand you, it's only someone like you.
We are nothing alike.
More than you might realize.
Did you have to destroy the only thing that made sense in your life? Did you have to betray everything you were taught to believe from birth?
No, you know nothing about me. I told you people I wanted to be left alone.
And we obliged. Although you would do well to see a doctor, given your state.
I am fine.
We both know that's not true. You can't be after what happened.
I saved the world. Isn't that enough for you to leave me be?
I would if I didn't care. This shouldn't be the end of Grigory Lemontov, should it?
You are on a suicide watch. Men are betting how long you are gonna last, the longest guess being three years.
You refuse to eat and drink very little. You don't sleep at night, you don't communicate, you lost weight. You are a shadow of your former self.
And your point is?
Get it together, Mr Lemontov, don't give up yet. 
I have nothing left to live for and your empty words are not going to change that.
This visit is over. Guards, I want to go back to my cell!
Don't bother visiting again, Mr Dyaconsen. Don't waste your time on me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where did you get this?
In one of tents on Kolguyev. Livanokh's personal stash perhaps?
This is from the day you attacked Everon, isn't it?
Yes. I still remember it like it was just yesterday.
And it's already been a year. Have a look at the others as well.
The next one is my personal favourite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How's Lemontov's cell construction coming along?
It was postponed due to...
Prioritize it. The man deserves at least a fucking view.
Yes, sir!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I don't need doctors to tell me you are in a bad spot. Is this the fate you imagine for yourself? Dying in a western prison?
Don't let this be the end. Get it together, Mr Lemontov, and rise once more. Don't give up yet.
Are you done? Can I get back to my cell?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter your actions, you always lived with consequences. You never faltered and you proved to be a formidable opponent.

We are both patriots putting the country and its people above all else. We play politics not because we want to, but because we have to.
We make the hard decisions, we lead the men. We take the blame and only sometimes the credit.
We do what is necessary no matter the cost. We have to do things others have not the stomach to even consider.

We do what we must because no one else would. That's why we're sitting across this table right now, Mr Lemontov.
The choices we made led us here. How you decide to proceed is only up to you.
Nice speech, Mr Dyaconsen, but I am stuck here for the foreseeable future in case you didn't notice.
It might take fifteen years, it might take less or more, but you will return outside. And you want to be ready when you do.
Can you... can you tell me anything? About the outside?
No, I am sorry... I can't even if I wanted to.
But I will try to make your stay here more pleasant that much I can promise you.
I... I appreciate it, Mr Dyaconsen.
Do not worry about it, Mr Lemontov. I think the world owes you a debt of gratitude whether the people realize it or not. This is the least I can do.

Our time is up. I have some other business to attend to here. I'll be back, Mr Lemontov, stay safe until then. Or at least try.
Goodbye for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, Fred, big shots came in this morning. They want the Spec Op, in the hangar E.
Hangar E, got it. I'll fetch him.
Take my jeep. See you later.
Hold on, George, are we still up for tonight?
Of course. We've got cards and whiskey taken care of - come before nightfall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't. I already told you all I know. I saved your asses - isn't that enough for you to leave me be?
You barely told us anything. And I did not expect you to - whatever you describe yourself in your head, you are no traitor.
How would you describe killing my commander, my countryman, my brother? Destroying the last chance he had to win the war?
A hero. In spite of all your flaws, you did the right thing in the end. You did not let emotions cloud your judgment. 
You know he had to be stopped. His actions would destroy the world as we know it and millions would die.
It is the reason you're still breathing - prosecution demanded death penalty at first.
Maybe I should have been shot. Would you have done the honours?
Nonsense. You are useless dead, you need to know that.
How useful am I in your prison?
You're alive and that's important. If you wanted to end it so much you could have just attacked the guards. They have orders to shoot if you try anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, I'm here for the prisoner.
You can find him over there. He's sitting in the grass looking over the sea.
You let him?
He's been there like this the whole night. I had to change guards three times. The bastard's got VIP treatment, not much I can do.
After killing so many of us, really? Have you thought about putting a bullet through his head?
If you want to be charged with murder and end your carrier, go right ahead. That piece of shit is not worth it.

Grigory Lemontov, you have a visitor. I'm to take you to the hangars.
Follow me.

Take a seat, your visitor will be here shortly.


Hello, Mr Lemontov.
It has been a while. How are you?
They told me you do not speak too much, but I would expect at least a simple 'Hello'.
I can only imagine how you are feeling. Believe me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.
This is not one would imagine the menace of the east - sitting silently, without motion, defeated. It seems you have given up.
Is this how you see the next fifteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.
Have you come to mock me?
Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.
I lost everything that was ever dear to me. I was forced to kill my own brother, betraying my comrades and my country.
I had to do what was necessary to avert catastrophe even if it was the hardest thing I have ever done.
Branded as a traitor by my people and a murderer by you, I would rather be dead than to suffer this shame any longer.
I see you're full of anger, despair and hatred. Your guilt is dragging you down and it makes the world seem bleak.
You will get over it, I can promise you that. The pain will recede and you will heal - all in due time.
Speaking from experience?
We are from the same cloth, Mr Lemontov. If anyone can understand you, it's only someone like you.
We are nothing alike.
More than you might realize.
Did you have to destroy the only thing that made sense in your life? Did you have to betray everything you were taught to believe from birth?
No, you know nothing about me. I told you people I wanted to be left alone.
I understand, Mr Lemontov. Left alone you shall be - for a time.
Guards, we're done!
You will not get rid of me that easily. I'll be back.
Don't bother.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; year 2 1982

Hello, Mr Lemontov.
Is this going to be a yearly thing?
I am fairly busy, otherwise I would have come sooner.
I would actually prefer less frequency or never at all.
I brought you a few photos. I think you might find them interesting.
Where did you find these?
In a hidden stash on Kolguyev. You were aware there was a photographer on the island?
Of course. Before the war started, politburo requested pictures for some propaganda posters.
The next one is the most interesting one.
The bastard... He was planning it the whole time.
You can keep the photos, I have copies. Did you see the weapon?
Hard to miss. It confirmed what I feared.
Livanokh was going to use the weapon from the very beginning and you were not aware of it.
We trusted each other all our lives. We fought together for years, side by side. I cannot believe he tried to do this behind my back.
Why do you think is that?
He probably realized I would be against it. It was an insane plan, absolutely out of the question.
I would try to reason with him. If that wouldn't work, then I would try to stop him.
He did not tell me to avoid that. He knew me too well.
I should have realized. If only I wasn't so blind...
You should not blame yourself.
Who else am I to blame? I am aware of what I've done. I realized in the very end my errors but it's my fault that it came to that in the first place.
Nobody could have predicted the extent of Livanokh's rage, not even you.
I was a direct part of it. No matter what I thought, I helped him almost achieve his goal.
Almost is an important word.
I need time to think.
Of course, you have all the time in the world. 
Think carefully and find it in you to forgive yourself. I'll be back, Mr Lemontov.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I meant to ask you about Alexander Livanokh and your history.
I already told you everything.

Why did Alexander Livanokh not tell you about the weapons?
Another interrogation?
I'm trying to piece the puzzle together. In your own words, you were his most trusted companion, his brother. Why would he keep it away from you?
Perhaps he knew I wouldn't agree.
Weren't you two trying to destroy us?
Beat you on a battlefield, embarrass you by forcing you out of Malden - those were our goals. I would never agree to using weapons of mass destruction on civilian population.
Alexander knew me well. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last time you told me you were a traitor to your people. Is nuking the USA part of your constitution?
No, but shooting your own is.
It's good then the only people who know what truly happened in that villa are sitting in this very room.
You did not disclose it? Why?
I told you I wouldn't. The official version is that Livanokh resisted arrest and tried to fight. I was forced to defend myself.
The truth is our truth for now.
Why did you do it?
I already told you - you asked me to. But there is one other reason as well.
Alexander Livanokh had friends. Someone had to get the weapons in. Someone had to operate them.
You told us yourself you were not aware of any of it. Therefore, We can be sure that someone is still out there and you would not want them to be aware of your actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took you a whole year to get back?
I have things to do, Mr Lemontov. I couldn't have come any sooner and I am sorry for that.
It felt like an eternity. You were right, the cell wall is not that interesting anymore.
It took me close to two years but I am starting to think clearly again.
That is very good to hear, but I have been told that you hit the wall with your head eight times, that there were sixty seven sleepless nights and when you did get sleep you would trash around and scream 'murderer' from the top of your lungs.
Nice of you to keep track.
I'm not a doctor and I understand you did not wish to see any - but are you well, Mr Lemontov? Can I call off the suicide watch?
I have no intention of killing myself, Mr Dyaconsen. Although I did consider it several times. The solitude, the guilt, the uncertainty - it was a lot to take in and I needed time.
Whatever the future holds, I am of no use dead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


; year 3 1983


Mr Dyaconsen.
Hello, Mr Lemontov. That's a first.
I had a question for you.
Ask away.
I want to know about Rashiv. Did he contact you first?
Rashiv's involvement is officially top level classified information. Then again, you know most of it anyways.
We received strange signals way before your invasion on Everon. We weren't quite sure what they meant at first.
On Malden, the signals were more frequent and we managed to decipher them. They were pointing to a location on Everon.
The command centre.
Yes. We conducted a raid. With all the information about your troops and battle plans we obtained, we managed to push you back on Malden.
The signals kept coming in. Later, we eventually met personally on Everon.
When you came to the base, after the shooting - was he still alive?
No one was breathing by the time we got there, Rashiv among them.
My greatest mistake. He actually knew what Livanokh was planning or at least suspected it.
He tried to warn me once but I did not listen. He should have told me outright.
Would you have believed him?
No. I guess I had to see it with my own eyes to realize the truth. I had to hear it from Alexander himself.
Why did people have to die before that though? I was so stupid.
Making mistakes is part of our lives. You make progress by learning from them.
What you did and didn't do is in the past now, Mr Lemontov. Learn from it and look towards your future.
Certainly, the remaining twelve years between four wooden walls and a hole in the wall.
Your confinement is something I can try to improve. It might take a while though.
The most important stuff is in your head though. Stop blaming yourself for things outside of your control.
Realize that you saved the entire world. Realize that you are a hero and not a villain.
I understand what you're doing, Mr Dyaconsen. I thank you.
It is my pleasure. Next time we meet, I'll have something for you. See you until then, Mr. Lemontov.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Have you been enjoying the library?
A few dozen books can't keep me entertained for that long.
You're already through with them? Then I'll ask for more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; year 4 1984

Hello, Mr Dyaconsen.
Greetings, Mr Lemontov. Beautiful day, isn't it? We're going to go on a little walk.
Is that allowed?
You've been here for four years without an incident. A good behaviour if I do say so myself. From now on, you can go around the western part of the island without any difficulties.
Guards will shadow you, of course. But this time, they shall keep their distance, right boys?
Yes, sir!
Come, Mr Lemontov.

Malden is a little bit barren, isn't it? The local fauna can't quite compare to your thick forests of Kolguyev.
I hated it at first, but the island grows on you. It has a peculiar image that is quite unique to it.
I couldn't agree more. 
Now that we're away from prying eyes, we can talk freely. There is an important matter that you must learn.
The events at the villa - what truly happened that night - we are the only two people who know the truth.
What?
The official version is that Livanohk did not surrender and fought back. I had to defend myself and had to shoot.
Why?
Because you asked me to.
I did but I did not expect you to keep your word. I mean, what's in it for you?
It is helpful to you and that is important. You will not spend the rest of your life here, Mr Lemontov - one day you'll be free and you'll be allowed to return to your homeland.
Livanokh had friends - possibly at high places. Someone enabled him to get a nuclear warhead on the island. Someone had to operate it. Someone had to prepare it.
Whoever they were, they had to know what they were doing and why - so there is still someone out there who knows of Livanokh's plan.
Someone who wouldn't mind seeing it through. It is imperative they don't know of your actions in the villa - they should not have a reason to go after you and it gives you more breathing room.
I'm impressed you thought this far into the future.
You said it yourself - 'Don't tell the truth. You will make both our lives easier'. It is irony though that your reward is a prison cell while I received medals for something I have not done.
You'll manage, I'm sure. Thank you for trusting me, Mr Dyaconsen.
I thank you, Mr Lemontov, every year for saving us all.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we're away from prying eyes, 


They grow on you. The land is given a peculiar look that is quite unique.
You're right. 



I always felt they resemble the homes of their respective owners.
I can kind of see that, yes. I guess that clears the mystery why we colonized Malden in particular. 
I mean, deep forests are more your thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are they still ours?
We are away from prying eyes so we can talk freely. Yes, your people still control the island.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


; year 5 1985

Don't you think we are past the 'Mr' part?
Coming from you is very surprising but welcoming. All right, let's shake hands to it, Lemontov!
...
I jest. I appreciate you feel this way and I'll gladly call you Grigory from now on.
Likewise, George, likewise.

How do you feel?
I think I'm... fine, mostly. I still feel heavy thinking about that night and what I've done.
I don't think that feeling will ever go away. But I think I learned to accept it and am able to finally move past it.
That is very good to hear. You were in a bad spot the last couple of years.
I know. My world got turned upside down. It felt like everything lost its meaning. It helped me that you came in and talked. More than I care to admit.
That's a compliment enough, Grigory. I've heard you've been spending most of your time outside now.
Indeed, few times even slept under the stars. It is exactly what I needed and I think I have you to thank for that.
Stop with the thanks already, otherwise I'm going to think you actually lost your mind.
There's another thanks incoming - for the library.
You read through all the books?
There's not much you can do on this island - I could draw you a map to every bush, tree stump or a hole in the ground. On the western part.
There are hangars to the east - you never wanted to talk about it - why?
I cannot divulge that information. I already had to curry favours from a number of people to get you all this. 
Eastern part is off limits, Grigory, and will not change.
All right, you are risking I'll become so bored I might try to swim home.
That won't be necessary. I'll find you something to do, then, don't worry, Grigory.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are right, let's get back to the ground. You were saying something about Kolguyev?
Yes, it's been five years so I can tell you that the island is still under the control of your people.
You returned it?
Under some limitations, but yes. We did not actually have any legal reason to keep it.
What about making sure the last war doesn't happen again?
The Soviet diplomats were adamant. They did want to hear anything about occupation or annexation. 



; year 6 1986

Training - Afghanistan mission they were on "together"

Welcome, sir!
How's he doing?
Beaten most of our records, the bastard. A great idea from your side, sir!
What a devil.

How was it?
Twenty nine point five - faster by point six seconds.
Not bad, I'll try one more.

Grigory, take a break, will you? You're dragging my men's dignity through the mud.
Not my fault you failed to train them properly, George! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you as well, Grigory. You look great.
I feel great. I haven't even realized how much I was missing this. Care for a little race?
I wouldn't want to embarrass you. I'm also here only for a few minutes, I have to get back soon.
Is something the matter?
There's always something, Grigory. Let us step out for a moment.

If you're just dropping by that means you have business in the area.
I certainly do. Unfortunately, it's not something I'm looking forward to.
Does it have anything to do with my people?
Not at all, your people are all happy on their little island.
Kolguyev is still Russian?
Yes, although I was not supposed to tell you that. It was returned to your country shortly after the war.
You used to joke about swimming back home and didn't even realize how feasible it actually was.
Don't think about it, though. You wouldn't get far.
I sometimes forget we are still enemies.
If you want to call us that.
George, I am imprisoned by you with orders to shoot if I misbehave. Once I'm released, I can be sent back here with you as my target.
We will end up on opposing sides no matter how you look at it.
We are not going to end up, Grigory, we already are. And we never stopped being.
Why did you help me so much?
Was I supposed to let you rot here? 
Yes.
Maybe I was, but I am the only one who knows your true actions and I bear responsibility for your return so you can finish what you started.
What are you actually thinking will happen?
I do believe you are able to change things. Call it a gut feeling if you will. I never believed your path would end in this prison, on the contrary - your greatest feats are still before you.

Major Dyaconsen, sir, your presence is required.
I'm going, private, I'm going.
I'll be back, Grigory, keep with the training! You are going to need it!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's good to see you back to your full strength. At one point, you were but a shadow of your former self.
I had my high points and my low points. The villa was my lowest of them all. But it's been a steady rise ever since.
I'm counting down days until my sentence is up. There are but 3 287 days left.
That's still a lot to go.
Less then before and that's enough for me.
You certainly have changed. Or is this you before the whole incident?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there a war I am not aware of?
You know what I mean.
I get you, of course, but I do not see why there shouldn't be peace.
Peace? Between the Unites States and Soviet Union? What on earth have you been drinking?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But that's because someone else said so. I respect you both as a man and as a soldier. I don't care which flag you salute to.
You care when we meet on the battlefield.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is quite unfortunate we are from different worlds.
You never talked about your home.
Well, you never talked about yours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are not going to end up, Grigory, we already are. And we never stopped being.
Given a gun, would you shoot me?
Don't be ridiculous.
Given a gun and an order, would you shoot me?
Would you?
The fact you did not answer is an answer in and of itself. And yes, I would. I've never forgotten what kind of country you're serving, Grigory.
I didn't choose it. And I serve its people.
Those are the words of the menace of the east? You butchered your way through both the innocent and the guilty.

; year 7 1987

Beach - Spy swap


; outro (Le Port)

Goodbyes

There will be a time - and I am certain of it - there will be a time when we meet again.
I want to say it now - I am sorry.
What are you apologizing for?
I did not agree with it and I was against it. Remember that, Grigory. It's shameful of us. I hope you will forgive me.
George, what are you talking about?
When you learn it you will understand. I hope... I do hope you do not forget our friendship.
