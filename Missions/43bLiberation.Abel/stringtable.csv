INTRO

THE CAMP 
Rashiv telling his soldiers what happened at the church
Yashin did not make it
Belsky calls on the radio and tells Rashiv to go to Cancon (small farm) to liberate Lemontov


LEMONTOV and CHERNIKOV
I want to show Lemontov being prisoner, perhaps he can exchange some words with Chernikov?
Chernikov is a coward
callback to their talk if possible


CANCON
Rashiv coming over with his quad in the truck
Recognized before the farm and firefight breaks out



MISSION
Fight to the farm (reinforcements are in the back!)
