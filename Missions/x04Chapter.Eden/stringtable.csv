STRM_x04v01,"Postmaster Belsky!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v02,"You again...","",Belsky
STRM_x04v03,"Will you finally tell me why are my letters not going through?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v04,"Comrade Ablomov, you have been nagging me for days now. Don't you have other things to do?","",Belsky
STRM_x04v05,"I'm not leaving until you tell me.","",Ablomov

STRM_x04v06,"Does the simple answer of blockade satisfy you?","",Belsky
STRM_x04v07,"You mean to tell me the enemy is blockading us?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v08,"They're trying. Their fleet arrived a few weeks back and we have harder and harder time getting ships through.\nThe navy was forced to transport only the bare necessities and other important cargo.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v09,"Letters of simple soldiers are not among them.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v10,"That covers the sea route, do you want to tell me they also blockade the air?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v11,"Not yet.\nDo you expect us at logistics to waste valuable fuel to get your love letters to Russia?","",Belsky
STRM_x04v12,"I don't like your tone. And that was uncalled for.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v13,"Also, did you really just try the old 'there's no fuel' trick?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v14,"You want answers but you don't like them when I give them to you.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v15,"Because I smell bullshit. I wonder if you don't want to tell me or you can't.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v16,"You are entering a dangerous territory. I suggest you leave it.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v17,"I wrote to a dear person of mine and all I want is for them to read that letter. Is it that much to ask?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v18,"At a time when all sorts of information are valuable, it is indeed too much to ask.\nI will not comment on this further.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v19,"If you come around again I'll be forced to report you to your superiors.\nGoodbye, comrade Ablomov.","",Belsky

STRM_x04v20,"That could have gone better, but also a lot worse.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v21,"He's obviously following orders, but whose?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v22,"He's been dodging questions, talking about fuel shortages, dangerous territory, valuable information...","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v23,"Why me? Did I ever write anything out of the ordinary? I just described what was happening here, what we were doing...","",Ablomov

STRM_x04v24,"Comrade Lemontov, welcome. Now, we're only awaiting the arrival of comrade Volkov.\nYou haven't met with comrade Kukushkin, have you? Our new tank corps commander.","",Zubarev
STRM_x04v25,"It is an honour and a pleasure, comrade Lemontov.","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v26,"Comrade Frolov's death - how did it happen?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v27,"It was a bloody battle in the hills of Kolguyev.\nWe were outnumbered, but he fought like a lion. We won, but comrade Frolov died later in the hospital.","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v28,"Did he have his sunglasses on him?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v29,"I'm not sure, we never found them.","",Kukushkin

STRM_x04v30,"Comrade Army general, colonel Vladimir Volkov!","",Soviet soldier
STRM_x04v31,"At ease, comrades.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v32a,"Comrade Kukushkin, I am glad you decided to join us.\nTogether we shall build a better future for our descendants. ","",Volkov
STRM_x04v32b,"Most people are too afraid and lack the will to do what is necessary. You are not among them.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v33,"I'm at your command, comrade Volkov!","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v34,"Comrade Lemontov, I've been given reports of your activities on Everon.\nYou have done well and proved that you are still the same comrade who was taken from us seven years ago.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v35,"Forgive me for not trusting you sooner, I had to be careful.\nWe weren't quite sure whether you returned a completely different man or perhaps even a spy.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v36,"It's alright, comrade Volkov. I would not have trusted myself either.","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v37,"Now that we can be open with each other, it is time to finish what you started so long ago.\nAnd there is only one place where that can be done.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v38,"Malden.","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v39a,"It is obvious, but yes, Malden.\nThe impenetrable fortress of the enemy is well within our grasp.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v39b,"It is there the age old conflict between the west and the east shall be decided.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v40,"What you began seven years ago with comrade Livanokh we shall finish today.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v41,"But we failed. What makes you think you will succeed?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v42,"You bit off more than you could chew. Taking over the whole island is indeed a remarkable feat.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v43,"But that is not our goal. I recognize the mistakes of the past and I am not about to repeat them.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v44,"What is our strategy then?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v45a,"Step by step, we got to where we are today.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v45b,"Luring the Americans to overstep and interfere on Everon.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v45c,"Defending Kolguyev and getting stronger with each coming ship and plane.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v46a,"Backing of Kremlin is one thing, but comrade Livanokh never received substantial support he required,\nand when the tide turned he was betrayed.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v46b,"We made sure that can not happen.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v47,"We swept through Everon and destroyed all local resistance.\nThe only thing that stands between us and victory is Malden.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v48a,"Step by step, we shall remove that last obstacle out of the way\nand finally achieve comrade Livanokh's dream -","",Volkov
STRM_x04v48b,"- destroying the western vermin once and for all.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v49,"I ask again, what is our strategy?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v50,"There is a facility on the island built after the last war.\nShrouded in mystery and heavily guarded. Top secret.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v51a,"We managed to get a glimpse of what's inside.\nThe Americans are developing a new type of weapon, deadly weapon.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v51b,"It looks to be of nuclear origin and is strong enough to wipe out entire cities.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v52,"On Malden? Are you absolutely sure?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v53,"Positive. I couldn't believe it myself the first time I heard it, but it's true.\nWe obtained irrefutable evidence.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v54,"They might have chosen this area to be able to test it on us on Kolguyev, the bastards.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v55,"How is that possible? It's too far fetched to be true, surely? I would have known, I would have realized...","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v56,"Is this.. is this what George meant? They cannot get hold of that weapon!","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v57,"We shall take control of it and use it against them.\nReduce their cities on the western coast to dust.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v58,"That should send a clear message to our enemies as well as our 'friends'.\nTaking control of the Soviet Union after that will be child's play.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v59,"What about Kremlin? They can't seriously support this?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v60,"Their opinion is of no matter to us.\nWe have everything we require and their blessing is no longer necessary.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v61,"Let me show you, comrade Lemontov.","",Volkov

STRM_x04v62,"Soldiers of the Red Army!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v63a,"Everon has been finally reclaimed!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v63b,"Its people are now safe under our protection and it is only thanks to you and your courage!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v64a,"We have achieved a great victory today and a moment like this calls for a celebration!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v64b,"Each and every will receive a bottle of vodka to properly toast to your success!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v65,"Rejoice, comrades! The enemy has been vanquished and retreated to his home island of Malden!\nThe Red Army stands victorious!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v66,"Alas, our work is not yet done.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v67,"I have received a telegram from the General Secretary himself. The Kremlin has more orders for us!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v68a,"Our victory pleases them and they want us to continue -","",Volkov
STRM_x04v68b,"- to finish the work we started by taking over Malden\nand kicking the enemy out of the area once and for all!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v69,"It is the only way to peace! A total victory, comrades, is within our grasp!","",Volkov

STRM_x04v70,"If my letters are blocked because of what they contain... that must mean our command hides are intentions... and we never received orders to go further to Malden...","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v71,"What is happening here? Why all the secrecy? Whose orders are we even following if it's not our high command anymore?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v72,"What does this mean for those back home? For Ekaterina?","",Ablomov

STRM_x04v73,"Will you follow me to the island of Malden and claim it for Mother Russia?\nWill you be part of the greatest victory over the west in our lifetime?!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v74,"Will you bring fame and glory to our nation one last time?!\nFor victory, I say, to Malden!","",Volkov

STRM_x04v75,"Malden! Malden! Malden!","",Soldiers

STRM_x04v76,"Look at Lemontov, standing beside the others like he's part of them now. It makes me sick.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v77,"This was his plan all along, it seems it worked out.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v78,"His plan involved butchering the last remnants of free people of Everon?","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v79,"Of course not, but Grigory is willing to go far to reach his goal.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v80,"Too far if you ask me. What exactly has he achieved?","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v81,"He infiltrated their group.\nA very dangerous position, but he should have now access to their information and plans\nand can act accordingly to stop them.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v82,"I hope it was worth for him. I would not be able to sleep with his conscience.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v83,"He's done a lot of questionable things in his life. Some very dark and tragic. Maybe this is his way of atoning for his sins.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v84,"Atoning for old sins while committing new ones.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v85,"He very much believes the end justifies the means.\nVolkov needs to be stopped, Sergey, the incredible danger he poses is very much worth the lives of few rebels.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v86,"We could have avoided all of this if Lemontov were to simply ask them about their plans,\nnone of this plotting and secrecy.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v87,"He's done something that they would not approve of - they would kill him were they to find out.\nIf he didn't tell you, I am not going to. But you should ask him, it concerns you as well.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v88,"It does not.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v89,"It concerns your father.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v90,"I asked him twice about my father's death and he evaded the question both times.\nHe doesn't trust me, even after what we've been through.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v91a,"He was never honest with me. He knows how my father died and refuses to tell me the truth.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v91b,"He does what most benefits him and his grandiose goal of saving the world\nfrom whatever Volkov is supposedly after.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v92,"He is a dangerous...","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v93,"I could not care less. If you don't trust me, I don't have a reason to trust you.\nI'll never forgive him for what he's done, no matter how noble reasoning he had.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v94,"I believe he could have acted differently, there is always a choice.\nHe chose his way and I am choosing mine.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v95,"Do whatever you wish about Volkov and Zubarev, this does not concern me anymore. I am done.","",Rashiv
