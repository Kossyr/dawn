STRM_x04v01,"Postmaster Belsky!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v02,"You again...","",Belsky
STRM_x04v03,"Will you finally tell me why are my letters not going through?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v04,"Comrade Ablomov, you have been nagging me for days now. Don't you have other things to do?","",Belsky
STRM_x04v05,"I'm not leaving until you tell me.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v06,"I'll repeat what I already told you - our supply routes are long and there have been delays.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v07,"Comrade Belsky, just yesterday I saw a number of new ships in the port unloading cargo.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v08,"Weapons and medecine are of higher priority and they get through the delays quicker...","",Belsky
STRM_x04v09,"Bullshit! I could have believed you few weeks back, but I know that's not the case!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v10,"Everything was smooth while we were fighting on Kolguyev! Ever since our victory and reconquest of Everon, I have not received a single reply and I doubt my letters are going through either.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v11,"Should I ask around and find out how many other soldeirs have the same issue even if they themselves do not realize it?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v12,"This is unbecoming of you. I should report you to your commanding officer!","",Belsky
STRM_x04v13,"Do that, I don't care. The more people we involve, the better. Everyone should be concerned there is no communication between us and the mainland!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v14,"Alright, not so loud! You don't know what you're getting yourself into!","",Belsky
STRM_x04v15,"So, you admit there is something going on. Talk.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v16,"It is dangerous, comrade Ablomov, you have no idea. It is far greater than you or me. You should drop it and walk away.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v17,"I already said I'm not going anywhere. Tell me.","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v18,"Nobody outside my group should know. You must keep it to yourself, no questions!","",Belsky
STRM_x04v19,"Alright, alright, just tell me already!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v20,"There has been an order - from very high up - to cut off all communication to and from the archipelago. Letters, packages, telegrams, fax messages - nothing gets through.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v21,"There is a big warehouse on Kolguyev where all items are stored. They are not forwarded to their recipients.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v22,"Why would someone do that?","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v23,"Why, comrade Ablomov, think! Who would have the necessary authority? Who would have a reason? Who would benefit from it?","",Belsky

STRM_x04v24,"Comrade Lemontov, welcome. Now, we're only awaiting the arrival of comrade Volkov. You haven't met with comrade Kukushkin, have you? Our new tank corps commander.","",Zubarev
STRM_x04v25,"It is an honour and a pleasure, comrade Lemontov.","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v26,"I heard comrade Frolov died. How did it happen?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v27,"It was a bloody battle in the hills of Kolguyev. We were outnumbered, but he fought like a lion. We won, but comrade Frolov died later in the hospital.","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v28,"Did he have his sunglasses on him?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v29,"I'm not sure, we never found them.","",Kukushkin

STRM_x04v30,"Comrade Army general, colonel Vladimir Volkov!","",Soviet soldier
STRM_x04v31,"At ease, comrades.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v32,"Comrade Kukushkin, I am glad you decided to join us. Together we shall build a better future for our descendants. Most people are too afraid and lack the will to do what is necessary. You are not among them.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v33,"I'm at your command, comrade Volkov!","",Kukushkin
STRM_x04v34,"Comrade Lemontov, I've been given reports of your activies on Everon. You have done well and proved that you are still the same comrade who was taken from us seven years ago.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v35,"Forgive me for not trusting you sooner, I had to be careful. We weren't quite sure whether you returned a completely different man or perhaps even a spy.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v36,"It's alright, comrade Volkov. I would not have trusted myself either.","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v37,"Now that we can be open with each other, it is time to finish what you started so long ago. And there is only one place where that can be done.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v38,"Malden.","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v39,"It is obvious, but yes, Malden. The impenetrable fortress of the enemy is well within our grasp. It is there the age old conflict between west and east shall be decided.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v40,"What you began seven years ago with comrade Livanokh, we shall finish today.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v41,"But we failed. What makes you think you will succeed?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v42,"You bit off more than you could chew. Taking over the whole island is indeed a remarkable feat.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v43,"But that is not our goal. I recognize the mistakes of the past and I am not about to repeat them.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v44,"What is our strategy then?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v45,"Step by step, we got where we are today. Luring the Americans to overstep and interfere on Everon. Defending Kolguyev and getting stronger with each coming ship and plane.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v46,"Backing of Kremlin is one thing, but comrade Livanokh never received substantial support he required and when the tide turned, he was betrayed. We made sure that can not happen.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v47,"We swept through Everon and destroyed all local resistance. The only thing that stands between us and victory is Malden.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v48,"Step by step, we shall remove that last obstacle out of the way and finally achieve comrade Livanokh's dream - destroying the western vermin once and for all.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v49,"I ask again, what is our strategy?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v50,"There is a facility on the island built after the last war. Shrouded in secrecy and mystery as well as heavily guarded. A top secret.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v51,"We managed to get a glimpse of what's inside. The Americans are developing a new type of weapon, deadly weapon. It looks to be of nuclear origin and is strong enough to wipe out entire cities.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v52,"On Malden? Are you absolutely sure?","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v53,"Positive. I couldn't believe it myself the first time I heard it, but it's true. We obtained irrefutable evidence.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v54,"They might have chosen this area to be able to test it on us on Kolguyev, the bastards.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v55,"How is that possible? It's too far fetched to be true, surely? I would have known, I would have realized...","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v56,"But it does makes sense. Is this what George meant? They cannot get hold of that weapon!","",Lemontov
STRM_x04v57,"We shall take control of it and use it against them. Reduce their cities on the western coast to dust.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v58,"That should send a clear message to our enemies as well as friends. Taking control of the Soviet Union after that will be child's play.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v59,"What about Kremlin? They can't seriously support this?
STRM_x04v60,"Their opinion is of no matter to us. We have everything we require and their blessing is no longer necessary.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v61,"Let me show you, comrade Lemontov.","",Volkov

STRM_x04v62,"Soldiers of the Red Army!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v63,"Everon has been finally reclaimed! Its people are now safe under our protection and it is only thanks to you and your courage! I salute you, comrades!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v64,"We have achieved a great victory today and a moment like this calls for a celebration! Each and every will receive a bottle of vodka to properly toast to your success!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v65,"The enemy has been vanquished and retreated to his home island of Malden! The Red Army stands victorious!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v66,"Alas, our work is not yet done.","",Volkov
STRM_x04v67,"I have received a telegram from the General Secretary himself. The Kremlin has more orders for us!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v68,"Our victory pleases them and they want us to continue - to finish the work we started by taking over Malden and kicking the enemy out of the area once and for all!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v69,"It is the only way to peace! A total victory, comrades, is within our grasp!","",Volkov

STRM_x04v70,"Controlling the narrative. I doubt Kremlin is aware of any of this, perhaps even the reconquest of Everon.","",Belsky
STRM_x04v71,"He can't get away with it!","",Ablomov
STRM_x04v72,"What would you be able to do about it? Just lower your head and follow orders, this is above you and me.","",Belsky

STRM_x04v73,"Will you follow me to the island of Malden and claim it for Mother Russia? Will you be part of the greatest victory over the west in our lifetime?!","",Volkov
STRM_x04v74,"Will you bring fame and glory to our nation one last time?! To victory, I say, to Malden!","",Volkov

STRM_x04v75,"Malden! Malden! Malden!","",Soldiers

STRM_x04v76,"Look at Lemontov, standing with the others like he's part of them now. It makes me sick.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v77,"This was his plan all along, it seems it worked out.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v78,"His plan involved butchering the last remnants of free people of Everon?","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v79,"Of course not, but Grigory is willing to go far to reach his goal.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v80,"Too far if you ask me. What exactly has he achieved?","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v81,"He's in their group. A very dangerous position, but he should have now access to their information and plans and can act accordingly to stop them.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v82,"I hope it was worth for him. I would not be able to sleep with his conscience.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v83,"He's done a lot of questinable things in his life. Some very dark and tragic. Maybe this is his way of atoning for his sins.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v84,"Atoning for old sins while commiting new ones.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v85,"He very much believes the end justifies the means. Volkov needs to be stopped, Sergey, the incredible danger he poses is very much worth the lives of few rebels.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v86,"So you are on his side, great. I still don't understand why he couldn't simply ask Volkov or Zubarev about his plans. Why all the secrecy?","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v87,"He's done something that they would not approve of - they would kill him. If he didn't tell you, I am not going to. But you should ask him, it concerns you as well.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v88,"It does not.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v89,"It concerns your father.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v90,"I asked him twice about my father's death and he evaded the question both times. He doesn't trust me, even after what we've been through.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v91,"He was never honest with me. He knows how my father died and refuses to tell me the truth. He does what most benefits him and his grandiose goal of saving the world from whatever Volkov is supposedly after.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v92,"He is a dangerous...","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_x04v93,"I could not care less anymore. If you don't trust me, I don't have a reason to trust you. I'll never forgive him for what he's done, no matter how noble reasoning he had.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v94,"I believe he could have acted differently, there is always a choice. He chose his way and I am choosing mine.","",Rashiv
STRM_x04v95,"Do whatever you wish about Volkov and Zubarev, this does not concern me anymore. I am done.","",Rashiv
