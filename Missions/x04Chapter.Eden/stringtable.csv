Postmaster Belsky!
You again...
Will you finally tell me why are my letters not going through?
Comrade Ablomov, you have been nagging me for days now. Don't you have other things to do?
I'm not leaving until you tell me.
I'll repeat what I already told you - our supply routes are long and there have been delays.
Comrade Belsky, just yesterday I saw a number of new ships in the port unloading cargo.
Weapons and medecine are of higher priority and they get through the delays quicker...
Bullshit! I could have believed you few weeks back, but I know that's not the case!
Everything was smooth while we were fighting on Kolguyev! Ever since our victory and reconquest of Everon, I have not received a single reply and I doubt my letters are going through either.
Should I ask around and find out how many other soldeirs have the same issue even if they themselves do not realize it?
This is unbecoming of you. I should report you to your commanding officer!
Do that, I don't care. The more people we involve, the better. Everyone should be concerned there is no communication between us and the mainland!
Alright, not so loud! You don't know what you're getting yourself into!
So, you admit there is something going on. Talk.
It is dangerous, comrade Ablomov, you have no idea. It is far greater than you or me. You should drop it and walk away.
I already said I'm not going anywhere. Tell me.
Nobody outside my group should know. You must keep it to yourself, no questions!
Alright, alright, just tell me already!
There has been an order - from very high up - to cut off all the communication to and from the archipelago. Letters, packages, telegrams, fax messages - nothing gets through.
There is a big warehouse on Kolguyev where all items are stored. They are not forwarded to their recipients.
Why would someone do that?
Why, comrade Ablomov, think! Who would have the necessary authority? Who would have a reason? Who would benefit from it?
I don't... I...

Comrade Lemontov, welcome. Now, we're only awaiting the arrival of comrade Volkov. This is comrade Kukushkin, our newest recruit.
It is an honour and a pleasure, comrade Lemontov.
I heard comrade Frolov died. How did it happen?
It was a bloody battle in the hills of Kolguyev. We were outnumbered, but he fought like a lion. We won, but comrade Frolov died later in the hospital.
Did he have his sunglasses on him?
I'm not sure, we never found them.

Comrade Army general, colonel Vladimir Volkov!
At ease, comrades.
Comrade Kukushkin, I am glad you decided to join us. Together, we shall build a better future for our descendants. And we shall start with that today.
I'm at your command, comrade Volkov!
Comrade Lemontov, it is with upmost pleasure that I welcome you to our group.
