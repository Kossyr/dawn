STRM_08v01,"Hey, you! Soviet! Put the gun down or we shoot to kill!",Calvet
STRM_08v02,"Didn't you hear?! Comply or die!",partisan
STRM_08v03,"All right, we take him to the others.\nWe go to the forest. You go between us. You make a sudden move, you die. Let's go.",Calvet

STRM_08v04,"Where did you find this one?",Poincare
STRM_08v05,"By the shoreline. He was alone.",Calvet
STRM_08v06,"What about the others?",Poincare
STRM_08v07,"There are bodies by the road. His unit didn't get past the front in time it seems.",Calvet
STRM_08v08,"What are we supposed to do with him?",Calvet
STRM_08v09,"You brought him here. You should answer that question.",Poincare
STRM_08v10,"I.. didn't think that far. But any information about the enemy will be useful.",Calvet
STRM_08v11,"Doubtful he has anything interesting to give us.\nHis army just retreated to their island, defeated after their debacle at Montignac.",Poincare
STRM_08v12,"I would take his gear and gun and leave him for the Americans. Let them do with him what they please.",Poincare
STRM_08v13,"I like his boots.",partisn
STRM_08v14,"I'm taking the gun!",partisan

STRM_08v15,"I very much like those boots and my gun, good men. Don't we have a common enemy? Can't we negotiate?",Rashiv
STRM_08v16,"He speaks French!",Calvet
STRM_08v17,"I noticed, Pierre.\nWell, well, this is surprising then. If you've understood everything then you know what awaits you if you do not cooperate.",Poincare
STRM_08v18,"Of course I'll cooperate. We are allies after all, right?",Rashiv
STRM_08v19,"Ha ha ha.",everyone
STRM_08v20,"Good one.",partisan
STRM_08v21,"No, we are very far from allies. Your kind has attacked us once before. We didn't forget and we didn't forgive.\nYou should be glad we didn't shoot you on sight. What is your name?",Poincare
STRM_08v22,"Private Sergey Rashiv, Soviet Army. We were retreating from the island but were ambushed. I alone survived.",Rashiv
STRM_08v23,"Seeing your comrades die in front of you is never easy. And you did get through the enemy lines... quite resourceful, aren't you?",Poincare
STRM_08v24,"I think you can be useful.\nAs I see it, we basically saved your life since you wouldn't survive much longer on your own. That means you now help us.",Poincare
STRM_08v25,"Well, I thank you for your offer though I'd rather get back to that bay where you found me and wait for the ships to come back.",Rashiv
STRM_08v26,"Your army is not coming back, they're on their way to Kolguyev by now. Your only choice is either the Americans or us.",Poincare
STRM_08v27,"Very well, I see your point. In that case, I'd be glad to help you.",Rashiv 
STRM_08v28,"Splendid. Pierre, brief him on the way. Everyone, get ready and let's go.",Poincare

STRM_08v29,"Listen up, boys. Our goal is the small base behind this forest.\nLoads of Soviet equipment were left there and the Americans guard it lightly.",Calvet
STRM_08v30,"We go in quickly, load whatever we can on trucks, then leave by the road and hide in the hills to the east.",Calvet
STRM_08v31,"Let's go!",Calvet

STRM_08r01,"RAVEN TO NIGHTINGALE. HOW'S IT GOING, JEAN? WHAT'S THE STATUS? OVER.",Calvet
STRM_08r02,"NIGHTINGALE HEARS YOU, RAVEN. MOST OF THE ENEMY TROOPS ARE IN THE SOUTH. THE ROAD IS CALM. WE HAVE A GOOD OPENING. REPORT WHEN YOU'RE DONE. OUT.",Poincare
STRM_08r03,"WE'RE APPROACHING THE BASE NOW. GET READY!",Calvet
STRM_08r04,"GOOD WORK, WE'RE DONE. THEY DIDN'T EVEN MANAGE TO UNLOAD THE SOVIET TRUCKS. MAKES IT EASIER FOR US. GET IN EVERYONE, WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT QUICKLY!",Poincare
STRM_08r05,"RAVEN TO NIGHTINGALE, WE'RE LEAVING THE BASE IN TRUCKS. OVER.",Calvet
STRM_08r06,"BEWARE RAVEN, ENEMY PATROLS IN LEVIE. WE ARE DEPLOYING SMOKES TO COVER YOU. HEAD TO THE SECOND JUNCTION PER PLAN, STILL NOTHING FROM THE SOUTH. OUT.",Poincare
STRM_08r07,"NIGHTINGALE TO RAVEN, ENEMY TRUCKS COMING AFTER YOU. NORTH AND SOUTH, CLOSE. TAKE CARE OF THEM, THEN RETREAT TO THE HILLS. OUT.",Poincare
STRM_08r08,"AMMO TRUCKS CONTINUE ON, WE'LL COVER YOU!",Calvet
