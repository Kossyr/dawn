   <b>7.11.1986</b> - Out of frying pan into the fire. Our unit was ambushed and we had to continue on foot. The enemy took Levie and kept pushing south. We tried to cross the road and get to the bay where our ships would be waiting.
   <br><br>
   They didn't make it. I was left alone with only one clear goal - get to that bay. I don't even know how I did it but I just kept going and got through. Only to discover the ships were long gone. If they ever arrived in the first place.
   <br><br>
   Immediately seized by the resistance. It turns out our "allies" don't hold us in high regard. They were just about ready to strip me of my gear and leave me for the enemy to capture. Only my knowledge of their language changed their mind and now I am part of their group I guess. Although they do not trust me, they left me with my gun and took me with them on a mission. Uneasy partnership I'd say.
   <br><br>
   They are my only hope for survival right now. I need to keep them on my side and try to find a way to get back to Kolguyev when the chance arises.

    Soviet tropps left a lot of equipment in the wake of their hasty retreat. Americans seized the deserted bases but they did not have time to relocate captured equipment yet. This is a chance to enrich our weapon stock.
    <br><br>
    Our target is a <a href="marker:Base">small base</a>. It is lightly guarded as most enemy troops are still in the south. Seize all the weapons you can find and some trucks preferably. Take what you can and retreat by the road to the <a href="marker:End">hills</a> in the east.
