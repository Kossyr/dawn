STRM_27v01,"Any news from Stas?","",rashiv
STRM_27v02,"Not yet. Have patience, Sergei. We must be slow and methodical.","",lemontov
STRM_27v03,"I understand. I am just wary.","",rashiv
STRM_27v04,"We all are. But tell me, Sergei, your father's letters, what he did write you about?","",lemontov
STRM_27v05,"Well, mostly he was worried about me actually. Crazy given that he was in a middle of a war and I was still to secondary school.\nBut sometimes he would tell me about the war and his feelings.","",rashiv
STRM_27v06,"He said he had doubts. He did not believe the war was justified and right. He did not like how the war was going.\nHe must have been talking about the nuclear warhead, right?","",rashiv
STRM_27v07,"Surely, but there might be more in his words.","",lemontov
STRM_27v08,"Like what?","",rashiv
STRM_27v09,"Your father was a very progressive man. He believed in justice but not the one that we possess.\nHe believed in equality and freedom for everyone.","",lemontov
STRM_27v10,"Are you implying my father was a dissident?","",rashiv
STRM_27v11,"I'm just telling you facts. He would never go against the Soviet Union, you can be sure of that.\nHe loved his country in the same way we all do.\nBut he did believe there were things which could have been done differently. Better.","",lemontov
STRM_27v12,"I think I understand. We never spoke of it, but what you say makes sense.\nI must say I share this ideal. I am no traitor but I am not blind as to not see our shortcomings.","",rashiv
STRM_27v13,"Then we are in the same boat. I am glad for that. You truly are your father's son.","",lemontov
STRM_27v14,"Thanks, Grigory. My father would be proud no doubt. What I would give to have him by my side.\nI never told you but I have never forgiven the Americans for shooting him. I understand it was a war but I will never forgive them.\nIf I knew the person who pulled the trigger I would shoot him in a heartbeat like he shot my father.","",rashiv
STRM_27v15,"You said you knew him, Grigory. How come he died that day? What is the chaos of retreat? Did he cover our units while they escaped?\nTo this day I still have no official word of what happened. But you were there! Weren't you?","",rashiv
STRM_27v16,"It was chaos, Sergei, more than you can even imagine. A lot happened in the last days of that blasted war.\nBut we should not dwell on the past. I have a mission in few hours and have to get ready.\nI'll see you later, Sergei, good luck out there.","",lemontov
