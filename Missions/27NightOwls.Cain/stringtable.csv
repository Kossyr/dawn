STRM_27v01,"Stas has some contacts at MVD back in Moscow. He's trying to get some information from them but it's slow.",Lemontov
STRM_27v02,"In the meantime, you should be careful around Zubarev. He's Volkov's right hand man and is normally in charge.",Lemontov
STRM_27v03,"But Volkov put you in charge, no? Doesn't that mean something?",Rashiv
STRM_27v04,"He can easily demote me the moment Kolguyev is retaken. I don't consider this meaningful in any way.",Lemontov
STRM_27v05,"Volkov has always been methodical. He's slow and careful, has a plan for everything. This might all be a part of his strategy.",Lemontov
STRM_27v06,"To be honest, I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.",Rashiv
STRM_27v07,"We're still on Kolguyev, Sergey. Wait for events to unfold. And be on your guard.",Lemontov
STRM_27v08,"He might just be following orders. Like you did with my father during the first war.",Rashiv
STRM_27v09,"True, we... followed orders and back then it seemed Livanokh was following them as well. Only at the end we realized how mistaken we were.",Lemontov
STRM_27v10,"We must not do the same mistake again.",Lemontov
STRM_27v11,"You've said you knew my father, Grigory. Have you ever spoken?",Rashiv
STRM_27v12,"Sure, on number of occasions. I said you're just like him and I stand by that. One of the best men in the army.",Lemontov
STRM_27v13,"How come... How come he died? Was is the chaos of retreat? Did he cover our units while they escaped?",Rashiv
STRM_27v14,"To this day I still have no official word of what happened. But you were there! Weren't you?",Rashiv
STRM_27v15,"I understand your concerns, Sergey, but they are not easily addressed.",Lemontov
STRM_27v16,"It was... chaos, more than you can imagine. A lot has happened in the last days of that blasted war.",Lemontov
STRM_27v17,"Many... too many good men died, Vadim Rashiv among them - but we should not dwell on the past.",Lemontov
STRM_27v18,"I have a mission in a few hours and have to get ready.\nI'll see you later, Sergey, good luck out there.",Rashiv
