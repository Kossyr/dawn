<b>15th December 1988</b> - Afghanistan was a mess.
<br><br>
The war was going slowly. The mujahideen were hiding high up in the mountains and we had a hard time flushing them out. Our convoys kept getting intercepted and our ground patrols ambushed. We worked mostly during the night, but we didn't get that much done either. The Afghan rebels knew well where to hide and we had only a limited success. It was a good training for me at the very least, even better than Leningrad. I was back in the field and it made my blood flow again.
<br><br>
I had a group of spetsnaz under my command, Kaplinsky among them. We did not really grow close to each other, they mostly kept to themselves, the same as me. I knew not to trust my fellow countrymen just because we were fighting for the same country. I was on the lookout for Volkov's spies and so I silently followed orders.
<br><br>
Days became weeks and weeks became months. In the end, I spent over half a year in there. The conflict led nowhere and I was waiting for the time for the command to realize that and send us home.
<br><br>
Once, after a long night, we were called to the command tent. Our group was being reassigned to Kolguyev. It made me uneasy - it felt like returning to the scene of the crime.
<br><br>
When we finally arrived on Kolguyev at the beginning of November and were sent on the first helicopter to Everon - that's when I realized that everything was about to go haywire.

We took most of central Kolguyev but the hilly and mountainous areas are still under enemy control. We have to strike before the enemy fortifies his positions - this very night. We do not posses enough night equipment to mount a full scale attack, thus it falls mainly to spetsnaz to lead the charge. Mechanized squad Ivan will support your effort as they are equipped with night vision goggles.
<br>
In a few moments, squad Ivan will arrive in <a href="marker:Ivan">Astrabirsk</a> and will be waiting for your orders. The first phase has two objectives - a small checkpoint at a <a href="marker:Crossroads">crossroads</a> and a guarded <a href="marker:Camp">camp</a>. Call in Ivan to support your attack.
<br><br>
The second phase is seizing the important <a href="marker:MountainTop">mountaintop</a>. We do know the enemy has an Anti=Air gun stationed there - destroy it so we can send in the airborne units. Take a rocket launcher with you so you can take it out as fast as possible, then clear the area of enemy units.
<br><br>
You start in <a href="marker:Start">Astrabirsk</a>.

<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Seize the small fortified <a href="marker:Crossroads">crossroads</a> south of your starting position.</p>

<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Attack and clear out the enemy <a href="marker:Camp">camp</a> in the valley. Be watchful of enemy fortified positions around the valley.</p>

<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Advance on the <a href="marker:MountainTop">mountaintop</a> and destroy the Anti-Air gun stationed there.</p>

<br>
<p>The night operation was successful - we now control all of central Kolguyev. The enemy now holds onto the coastal areas which we will liberate soon enough.</p>
