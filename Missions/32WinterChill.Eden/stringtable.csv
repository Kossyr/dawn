STRM_32v01,"Volkov, Zubarev, Burtsov, Moltov, Limyen, Garodsky, Yenotov, Dyrbov, Aspidov and Shvernik...","",lemontov
STRM_32v02,"Some of the names I recognize from the old times. Most in the army, but there are politicnas and powerful party members too.","",lemontov
STRM_32v03,"A clique of sorts? There is no obvious connection. They do support common resolutions, but that could be coincidence.\nIs this everything Stas got out of Moscow?","",lemontov
STRM_32v04,"Ah, think Grigory, think! Volkov needed reinforcements... remote islands in the middle of the Pacific... the fastest plane can get here in twelve hours.\nLetters take weeks to deliver... There are only handful of radios capable of such a long distance...","",lemontov
STRM_32v05,"Far away and isolated... At the end of the world...","",lemontov
STRM_32v06,"Everon... Although an epicentre for both wars, it is not the price. The island is between Malden and Kolguyev.\nWhoever controls it can launch attacks against the other.","",lemontov
STRM_32v07,"Everon is only a stepping stone. A launching pad for the true invasion - of Malden.","",lemontov
STRM_32v08,"Whatever Volkov desires is on Malden. But what in the world is it?","",lemontov
STRM_32v09,"You used to be sharp, Grigory. You let yourself go too much.","",livanoch
STRM_32v10,"Ghosts of the past still haunt me, I see. Am I going crazy again?","",lemontov
STRM_32v11,"I would not call you crazy yet, although you are not very far off. Lack of sleep, empty stomach, stressed and fighting in a conflict you have no desire to be a part of.\nSome might call it sad.","",livanoch
STRM_32v12,"I truly needed a hallucination of my old friend to remind me.","",lemontov
STRM_32v13,"Old friend, you say? I stopped being your friend the moment you shot me in the head.","",livanoch
STRM_32v14,"Or did you forget?","",livanoch
STRM_32v15,"Never. Although I do regret it to this day. But I did not see any other way.","",lemontov
STRM_32v16,"You still cling to the last bit of humanity you have left, yet you ignore the cries of hundreds of souls you have killed.","",livanoch
STRM_32v17,"You spilled galons of innocent blood which still drips from your hands. Wherever you go, death follows.","",livanoch
STRM_32v18,"It used to be obedience which drove you. You fulfilled your orders without question and hesitation and where did that get you?\nThe best killer the Soviet Union has to offer.","",livanoch
STRM_32v19,"You realized your actions too late and one final deed was not enough to redeem your soul. You are guilt-ridden and unable to cope with what you've done.","",livanoch
STRM_32v20,"You are weak and blind to see the upcoming doom. The current of events is leading to a moment of truth. The moment you are so afraid of.\nAnd there is nothing you can do to stop it.","",livanoch
STRM_32v21,"Imagine, Lemontov, that despite all your hard work and all your sacrifices you will not succeed in the end.\nOn the contrary, your actions will actually lead to it.","",livanoch
STRM_32v22,"This is your fate and you may try to postpone it once more, but you cannot stop. It is inevitable. You will die, Lemontov, while not achieving anything. Stop resisting and accept it!","",livanoch
STRM_32v23,"Enough...","",lemontov
STRM_32v24,"Enough!","",lemontov
STRM_32v25,"I said enough! I cannot... I will not... let you... I have come too far to fail! Begone, ghost of Livanoch! Return to hell where you belong!","",lemontov
STRM_32v26,"I truly am going crazy...","",lemontov
