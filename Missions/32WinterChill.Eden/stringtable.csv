STRM_32v01,"Volkov, Zubarev, Burtsov, Moltov, Limyen, Garodsky, Yenotov, Dyrbov, Aspidov and Shvernik...","",lemontov
STRM_32v02,"Some of the names I recognize from the old times. Most in the army, but there are politicnas and powerful party members too.","",lemontov
STRM_32v03,"A clique of sorts? There is no obvious connection. They do support common resolutions, but that could be coincidence.\nIs this everything Stas got out of Moscow?","",lemontov
STRM_32v04,"Ah, think Grigory, think! Volkov needed reinforcements... remote islands in the middle of the Pacific... the fastest plane can get here in twelve hours.\nLetters take weeks to deliver... There are only handful of radios capable of such a long distance...","",lemontov
STRM_32v05,"Far away and isolated... At the end of the world...","",lemontov
STRM_32v06,"Everon... Although an epicentre for both wars, it is not the price. The island is between Malden and Kolguyev.\nWhoever controls it can launch attacks against the other.","",lemontov
STRM_32v07,"Everon is only a stepping stone. A launching pad for the true invasion - of Malden.","",lemontov
STRM_32v08,"Whatever Volkov desires is on Malden. But what in the world is it?","",lemontov

STRM_32v10,"Ghosts of the past still haunt me, I see. Am I going crazy again?","",lemontov
STRM_32v11,"I would not call you crazy yet, although you are not very far off. Lack of sleep, empty stomach, stressed, frustrated and fighting in a conflict you have no desire to be part of.\nSome might call it sad.","",livanoch
STRM_32v12,"I truly needed a hallucination of my old friend to remind me.","",lemontov

STRM_32v14,"Or did you forget?","",livanoch
STRM_32v15,"Never. But I did believe your death would end this madness. That it would bring peace.","",lemontov
STRM_32v16,"Ha ha, you are blind. You thought you solved the issue but now the current of events is once again leading to the grand finale you are so afraid of.","",livanoch
STRM_32v17,"You can slow it down, postpone it, but fate will still find you whenever you hide and force you to face your judgment. It is inevitable.","",livanoch
STRM_32v18,"You speak nonsense. I will not let you get away with this.\nI, Grigory Lemontov, will put stop to your schemes. I will kill every last follower of yours if I have to, but you shall not succeed!","",lemontov
STRM_32v19,"Begone, ghost!","",lemontov
