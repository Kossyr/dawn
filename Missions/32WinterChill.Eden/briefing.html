<b>26th January 1989</b> - It was the beginning of November when we arrived on Kolguyev. Half of the army was gone - on Everon. Zubarev was leading our men against the forces of NATO. This was bad. It felt like a nightmare that keeps repeating. I was away for a few months before fate brought me back to Malden archipelago. It seems my destiny lies here. Either I finish what I started or I die trying.
<br><br>
We immediately shipped to Everon on the first helicopter. I met Zubarev in Saint Pierre. We did not really see eye to eye, although he did give me a squad and a target - Lamentin. Our troops seized most of the southern part of the island and were now getting ready to attack Montignac, the capital city. A bold goal seeing we had very little tanks and no serious air support. The Americans were meanwhile amassing troops in the north. I should have seen the writing on the wall the moment I arrived.
<br><br>
I knew Vadim Rashiv had a son. He would talk about him on occasion. He followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted - and of course was assigned to Kolguyev. That November, he was on the front lines on Everon. I found him in Morton. I did not show myself, I just wanted to see him. He looked just like his father.
<br><br>
I would keep an eye on him. That's the least I owe to Vadim. I asked around and it seemed his squad was one of the best and his name specifically was mentioned several times.
<br><br>
I requested soldiers from several squads for the upcoming mission. They would support our strike at Lamentin but I did have one position in the Spetsnaz group - this place I requested to fill by someone from Rashiv's squad. Dostoevsky chose obviously and the next morning Rashiv arrived in our camp.
<br><br>
He did not say a word and he kept quiet the whole time. This was unlike Vadim. He was hurting, that much was obvious. His father's death hit him harder than I thought. But he was one hell of a soldier. The mission was a breeze. I was proud in a sense. He did not disappoint. But we had to go our separate ways and that was for a while the last time I saw him. During Montignac I was relocated to Saint Pierre and when the evacuation started, I was immediately flown away.
<br><br>
If I knew the trouble Sergey would get into, I would have jumped out of that helicopter in an instant and went straight north. It was miracle he got to the rebels, that they let him stay with them and finally that he was able to steal a boat and get to Kolguyev in one piece. Quite an incredible adventure for a private. Although considering his lineage, this is what I should have expected.
<br><br>
I would not let him out of my sight again. Since Dostoevsky and the rest of his squad lost their lives on Everon, I put him under Stanislav's squad. That way I was close to him even though he did not see it.
<br><br>
NATO attacked us on Kolguyev - again. They swept through the south and were marching north. I met with Sergey a few times and we even had a talk. Whatever happened to him on Everon made him talkative again and now he was so much like his father I sometimes felt I spoke with Vadim again. In those moments, I had to try hard to hide my feelings.
<br><br>
Zubarev lost on Everon and his subsequent orders lost us even more territory. Volkov had enough and I became the temporary commander-in-chief of our forces. I promoted Sergey to lieutenant and introduced him to our cause. I did not tell him everything - not yet - but he was on board. He understood the danger Volkov posed and was ready and willing to deal with it.
<br><br>
The war continued. Two times now he asked me about Vadim. Two times he inquired what I knew about his death. Two times I did not answer. It was painful and I felt awful, but I can't afford to lose him. Not now. Not yet. I will tell him one day - it is the least he deserves. But our objective is of greater importance - and nothing can get in the way.

We are finally ready to come back to Everon. The invasion shall start this very morning in the early hours. Your mission is to strike at the enemy strategic positions to support our attack.
<br><br>
There is a large air base at the edge of a <a href="marker:AirBase">forest</a> near Montignac. Your objective is to destroy as many helicopters as you can. The base is heavily guarded and it might be a good idea to try and lure the guards elsewhere. For this purpose, you can strike at enemy locations along the coast - <a href="marker:FuelStation">the fuel station</a>, <a href="marker:Depot">the supply depot</a> and <a href="marker:Port">the port</a>. 
<br><br>
You start at the <a href="marker:Start">rebel camp</a>. You have a selection of weapons to choose from. If you are low on ammo during the mission, either return to the base camp or rearm yourself at a hidden rebel <a href="marker:Stash">weapons stash</a>.

<br>
<p>A successful operation, comrade Lemontov. Now we can achieve air superiority and the invasion will be thus substantially easier. We are attacking in a few hours, join us in the north, comrade.</p>
