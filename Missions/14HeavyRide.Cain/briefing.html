   <b>5.12.1986</b> - Day two of me fighting for the Motherland.
   <br><br>
   The last two days were quite tense - everyone was getting ready for a big offensive which starts today. We were mostly on defense until now and it seems the command is pulling most of our forces to this battle. Our plan is to secure two bases, one in central and one in southern Kolguyev and conquer everything between. It is a bold plan and Yuri is in the centre of it. For Rodina!

	Today we are planning on launching a major offensive to advance the front further west. Combined assault of tanks and infantry will secure two bases and a significant amount of territory of central and southern Kolguyev.

	Forwards to victory, comrade!

    <br>
    <p>The offensive was a partial success, but the main target is still held by the enemy. Our position is not favorable and we'll probably have to retreat further north.</p>
