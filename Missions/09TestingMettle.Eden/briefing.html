<b>8th November 1988</b> - I helped the resistance and they took me in. Some are even welcoming, like Pierre. He is the one who took me captive, but right now he seems to be the closest to a friend I have on this island.
<br><br>
I tried to tell them I want to get off the island and back to Kolguyev but they still offer no help in this regard. I guess I'll have to help them some more before I get the chance to return to my own.
<br><br>
We are after medical supplies today. We are attacking a major enemy base. I am supposed to get the supplies out of the base under a covering fire. They see me as the most expendible I reckon. I'll show them yet.

Our medical supplies are dwindling. Meanwhile the Americans received a new shipment of medicine. We know it arrived in <a href="marker:Raid">Le Moule</a>.
<br><br>
We have no hope of actually taking the city, instead we mount a raid and take the medical supplies for ourselves. We know they are stored still in a truck in the northern part of town. We go in quickly, provide a cover fire for you to run in and get out of the city with the supply truck. Take it to a <a href="marker:Farm">farm</a> north of you which serves as our hospital in the area.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">close</a> to Le Moule.
