STRM_x05v15,"Whatever you call it, Grigory, my orders are to not let you through.",Dyaconsen
STRM_x05v16,"Is this what the last eight years led to? Do you want this to end with us gunning each other down in a fucking hangar?",Lemontov

STRM_x05v42,"Traitors.",Lemontov
STRM_x05v43,"You are surrounded, Lemontov. Drop your gun, or would you rather be shot?",Zubarev

COMMENT,"------------------- Livanokh reveal -------------------",
STRM_x05v56,"Hello, brother. Did you miss me?",Livanokh
STRM_x05v57,"How is this possible? You're supposed to be dead!",Lemontov
STRM_x05v58,"And yet here I stand and breathe as a free man for the first time in years in no small part thanks to you.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v59,"All hail comrade Alexander Livanokh!",Volkov
STRM_x05v60,"Hail!",everyone
STRM_x05v61,"Did you never stop to wonder whether I was truly dead? Whether that single bullet was enough to end me?",Livanokh
STRM_x05v62,"Especially a bullet fired from a gun in unsteady hands. You killed so many in my name yet you failed to kill me.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v63,"And so, at long last, I am back! Determined to finish what I started.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v64,"The world will learn to fear my name once more when the west coast of the United States is engulfed in flames and nuclear fallout.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v65,"I shall do hwt was once denied to me. The fall of the current world order is inevitable.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v66,"You're insane and you will be stopped.",Lemontov
STRM_x05v67,"By whom? You don't seem in any position to threaten me. Perhaps you mean your friends?",Livanokh
STRM_x05v68,"We know about your little group - comrades Shaposhnikov and Rashiv. We shall take care of them before they can cause any trouble.",Volkov
STRM_x05v69,"Your little conspiracy is null and void. We've known about your true allegiance from the start. You stood no chance.",Zubarev
STRM_x05v70,"Years ago, we started to look for you to find out where you were imprisinoed and found this place. That proved to be the easy part.",Volkov
STRM_x05v71,"We tried to contact you via radio transmitters. Getting them through the American defences was tough, though.",Volkov
STRM_x05v72,"Three years of unsuccessful attempts, we finally made contact - but it was not Lemontov on the other end - it was comrade Livanokh.",Zubarev
STRM_x05v73,"I've been imprisoned here around the same time as you. Right after I left the hospital after months long treatment, they put me here.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v74,"Our government feared me and were unwilling to let me return to the Soviet Union. They begged the Americans to keep me somewhere remote, somewhere I would not be able to influence anything anymore.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v75,"I was sentenced to spend the rest of my days on this island. Under lock and under guard, I was to rot away while they could forget I ever existed.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v76,"I was not about to give up and embrace my fate. I was not about to be forgotten!",Livanokh
STRM_x05v77,"I needed to wait and bide my time. I counted on my loyal comrades to search for me.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v78,"When we established connection, we learned the truth about the incident at the villa and knew what had to be done - freeing comrade Livanokh from his shackles.",Volkov
STRM_x05v79,"An opoortunity soon presented itself - a prisoner exchange for Lemontov. With you on our side, we knew we would be able to push the enemy and claim this island prison.",Volkov
STRM_x05v80,"We used you, your skills and expertise, to get us here. All the while you thought you were trying to thwart our plans in any way.",Zubarev
STRM_x05v81,"You were actually helping us from the start. We only had to keep in you in sight to make sure you wouldn't try anything before we got here. And you didn't.",Zubarev
STRM_x05v82,"You probably thought to take control of the nuclear bomb? Perhaps force us to back down and hand ourselves over to the government?",Volkov
STRM_x05v83,"Too bad the bomb is made up. Our goal was always comrade Livanokh.",Volkov
STRM_x05v84,"This is unreal. This must be a nightmare...",Lemontov
STRM_x05v85,"As you can see, all of this would not have been possible without your contribution, Grigory. For that you have my gratitude.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v86,"What I do not appreciate though is you betraying me. My imprisonment is your doing and if it was up to you, I would have been long dead.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v87,"You know how much I hate traitors. And you are a traitor, Grigory. To me, to our country, to our people.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v88,"You deserve to die a traitor's death.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v89,"But I'm gracious. I don't wish you dead, Grigory, unlike you I still value our friendship... no, no, our brotherhood. Beucase we were like brothers, weren't we?",Livanokh
STRM_x05v90,"You should live to see my plan come to fruition. The thing that you tried so hard to stop, you will witness it coming to pass.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v91,"After that, when you fully realize that you failed and everything you did was for naught, then I'll kill you myself.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v92,"You should do it now, to save yourself the trouble.",Lemontov
STRM_x05v93,"No, no, I want to see your face when the SCUD launcher fires the missile and it traverses the sky to destroy our greatest enemy.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v94,"The missile should be on its way, am I right, comrade Volkov?",Livanokh
STRM_x05v95,"Yes. We'll set up everything in the evening and tomorrow we can launch.",Volkov
STRM_x05v96,"No time to waste, then. Get Lemontov somewhere he will not cause any trouble. I'll call for him tomorrow.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v97,"Yes, comrade Lemontov.",Volkov
STRM_x05v98,"And deal with those friends of his. I don't want any surprises. The sooner we deal with this, the better.",Livanokh
STRM_x05v99,"By your orders, comrade Lemontov. I'll take care of it.",Zubarev
STRM_x05v100,"Go then. We have still much to do after we finish this up.",Livanokh
