; Part 1
; Kaplinsky and Lemontov by the hangars
; Lemontov and Dyaconsen talk
; Kaplinsky intervenes and takes Lemontov to a car, Dyaconsen disappears

Take some men and secure this hangar, Kaplinsky. I'll check the other one.
Yes, comrade Lemontov.
Vasily, Artyom, come here!

So it really is true. You are leading them.
George? Is that you?
In the flesh. I told you we would meet again. I was hoping it would be under different circumstances...
I'm still bound by my orders and my loyalty, but I presume you already figured everything out.
They told me, that's why I'm here.
I said it before and I'll say it again - I am sorry.
You thought it was a good idea to keep it a secret from me? Even though I lived next door for years?
I had orders I had to follow, no matter how much I disagreed. And I still do. I think we made a terrible mistake.
I concur. I can see it's not in here, that's clear. Tell me where it's hidden, I need to destroy it.
It? Interesting. Is that your way of coping nowadays?
Cut the crap, George, the others are right behind me and we haven't got much time. Tell me where it is.
Whatever you call it, Grigory, my orders are to not let you through.
Is this what the last eight years led to? Do you want this to end with us gunning each other down in a fucking hangar?
We are still on the other side of the barricade. I warned you this would happen.
Look around you, George, you have lost, we have taken control of the facility. It's only a matter of time before they find it.
But I need to find it first. You trusted me once before, trust me this last time.
Leave, get back to Malden, live to fight another day. Let me handle the bomb, then I take over the army and I promise we shall leave this whole area for good.
A bomb? What are you...
Comarade Lemontov, we need to go!
Get out of here, George...
Grigory, wait, I...
They're coming, go!
But...
Go, for fuck's sake!
Comrade Lemontov?
What is it, Kaplinsky?
Comrade Volkov is requesting our presence. In the eastern base.
What?
He'll explain everything. A car is waiting for us, come with me.


; Part 2
; Ride to the small base, Livanokh reveal
; Livanokh and Lemontov discussion
; Lemontov taken prisoner

Comrade Lemontov, so nice of you to join us.
What is going on? How are you all here?
We'll explain everything, comrade Lemontov, everything. But first, comrade Kaplinsky?
Drop your weapon, comrade Lemontov.
What are you doing?
Disarming you, comrade. The weapon, drop it.
What the fuck is the meaning of this? Have you gone mad?
We are so close to victory, I had it all under control. Let me get back to the hangars and...
No need. You are exactly where you are supposed to be.
Traitors.
You are surrounded, Lemontov. Drop your gun, or would you rather be shot?
I am quick enough to take one down with me. Care to volunteer, Zubarev?
I would like to see you try.
Don't test me.
Gentlemen, please, there is no need for this. Let's keep this civilized.
Drop your weapon, comrade Lemontov, there is no room for you to get out of this. 
We don't want to kill you...
Not yet...
... if we wanted you dead we've had plenty of opportunity before.
We have matters to discuss and believe you me, you will want to hear what is about to be said.
Shit.
Good, let us proceed. All clear!
No, no, no, no... not possible. Not real. It can't be... It must not...

Hello, brother. Did you miss me?
How is this possible? You're supposed to be dead!
And yet here I stand and breathe as a free man for the first time in years in no small part thanks to you.
All hail comrade Alexander Livanokh!
Hail!
Did you never stop to wonder whether I was truly dead? Whether that single bullet was enough to end me?
Especially a bullet fired from a gun in unsteady hands. You killed so many in my name yet you failed to kill me.
And so, at long last, I am back! Determined to finish what I started.
The world will learn to fear my name once more when the west coast of the United States is engulfed in flames and nuclear fallout.
I shall do hwt was once denied to me. The fall of the current world order is inevitable.
You're insane and you will be stopped.
By whom? You don't seem in any position to threaten me. Perhaps you mean your friends?
We know about your little group - comrades Shaposhnikov and Rashiv. We shall take care of them before they can cause any trouble.
Your little conspiracy is null and void. We've known about your true allegiance from the start. You stood no chance.
Years ago, we started to look for you to find out where you were imprisinoed and found this place. That proved to be the easy part.
We tried to contact you via radio transmitters. Getting them through the American defences was tough, though.
Three years of unsuccessful attempts, we finally made contact - but it was not Lemontov on the other end - it was comrade Livanokh.
I've been imprisoned here around the same time as you. Right after I left the hospital after months long treatment, they put me here.
Our government feared me and were unwilling to let me return to the Soviet Union. They begged the Americans to keep me somewhere remote, somewhere I would not be able to influence anything anymore.
I was sentenced to spend the rest of my days on this island. Under lock and under guard, I was to rot away while they could forget I ever existed.
I was not about to give up and embrace my fate. I was not about to be forgotten!
I needed to wait and bide my time. I counted on my loyal comrades to search for me.
When we established connection, we learned the truth about the incident at the villa and knew what had to be done - freeing comrade Livanokh from his shackles.
An opoortunity soon presented itself - a prisoner exchange for Lemontov. With you on our side, we knew we would be able to push the enemy and claim this island prison.
We used you, your skills and expertise, to get us here. All the while you thought you were trying to thwart our plans in any way.
You were actually helping us from the start. We only had to keep in you in sight to make sure you wouldn't try anything before we got here. And you didn't.
You probably thought to take control of the nuclear bomb? Perhaps force us to back down and hand ourselves over to the government?
Too bad the bomb is made up. Our goal was always comrade Livanokh.
This is unreal. This must be a nightmare...
As you can see, all of this would not have been possible without your contribution, Grigory. For that you have my gratitude.
What I do not appreciate though is you betraying me. My imprisonment is your doing and if it was up to you, I would have been long dead.
You know how much I hate traitors. And you are a traitor, Grigory. To me, to our country, to our people. 
You deserve to die a traitor's death.
But I'm gracious. I don't wish you dead, Grigory, unlike you I still value our friendship... no, no, our brotherhood. Beucase we were like brothers, weren't we?
You should live to see my plan come to fruition. The thing that you tried so hard to stop, you will witness it coming to pass.
After that, when you fully realize that you failed and everything you did was for naught, then I'll kill you myself.
You should do it now, to save yourself the trouble.
No, no, I want to see your face when the SCUD launcher fires the missile and it traverses the sky to destroy our greatest enemy.
The missile should be on its way, am I right, comrade Volkov?
Yes. We'll set up everything in the evening and tomorrow we can launch.
No time to waste, then. Get Lemontov somewhere he will not cause any trouble. I'll call for him tomorrow.
Yes, comrade Lemontov.
And deal with those friends of his. I don't want any surprises. The sooner we deal with this, the better.
By your orders, comrade Lemontov. I'll take care of it.
Go then. We have still much to do after we finish this up.





I failed. I see that now. Lock me up if you will, kill me if you have to, but let my friends be. They don't deserve...
Your friends are dead men walking. Don't waste your breath trying to save them.
It's me you want, you fucking...
Enough, we don't have time for that. 


This is a nightmare...
I have been told this would not have been possible without your contribution, Grigory. For that you have my gratitude.
What I do not appreciate though is you betraying me. My imprisonment is your doing and if it was up to you, I would have been long dead.
You know how much I hate traitors. And you are a traitor, Grigory. To me, to our country, to our people. 
You deserve to die a traitor's death.
But I'm gracious. I don't wish you dead, Grigory, unlike you I still value our friendship... no, no, our brotherhood. Beucase we were like brothers, weren't we?
You should live to see my plan come to fruition. The thing that you tried so hard to stop, you will witness it coming to pass.
After that, when you fully realize that you failed and everything you did was for naught, then I'll kill you myself.


You're insane and you will be stopped.
By whom? You don't seem in any position to threaten me. Perhaps you mean your friends?
We know about your little group - comrades Shaposhnikov and Rashiv. We shall deal with them before they can cause any trouble.
Your little conspiracy is null and void. We kept an eye on you from the start. You stood no chance.
You knew the whole time?
We've known for years. When they kept you a prisoner we quickly found out you were held here. That proved to be the easy part.
We tried to contact you via radio transmitters. Getting them through American defences was tough, though.
Three years of unsuccessful attempts, we finally made contact - but it was not Lemontov on the other end - it was comrade Livanokh.

Not only was he alive and kept prisoner at the same island.

Our government feared me and were unwilling to let me return to the Soviet Union. They begged the Americans to keep me somewhere remote, somewhere I would not be able to influence anything anymore.
After months spent in a hospital close to death, I was sentenced to spend the rest of my days on this island. Under lock and under guard, I was to rot away while they could forget I ever existed.
But hiding problems is not how you deal with them. I only had to wait and bide my time. I counted on my loyal comrades to search for me.
When we established connection, we learned the truth about the incident at the villa and knew what had to be done - freeing comrade Livanokh from his shackles.

Your friends are dead men walking. Don't waste your breath trying to save them.
It's me you want, you fucking...
Enough, we don't have time for that. 

They wanted to tuck me away and forget I ever existed. Out of sight, out of mind. 


A story time, then. Go on, do tell him. Tell him how much he fucked up.

No remarks, Grigory? We haven't seen each other for eight years and you have nothing to say?

What is this madness? What are you talking about?
We would have done never done it without you, Lemontov.
We used you from the start. With your expertise and knowledge you proved to be invaluable to our plans.
Thank you for bringing us here and helping to free our leader, comrade Alexander Livanokh.
I killed you. I shot you in the head!
You missed. Your shot was not fatal. It took me months in a hospital in a near death state, but I did survive.
Perhaps a small part of you could not just end me there and there, after all we've been through.
You shot once, hoping that one bullet would solve your inner struggle and all the other problems you imagined.
You were about to start a world war! I had to stop you.
Stop, perhaps, but kill? Face it, Grigory, you were not strong enough to trully mean it. If you did, I would not be here now.
How are you here, though?
When I returned to the world of the living, I was an outcast. Our government feared me, they were afraid of my influence and what I'm capable of.
You remember they betrayed us. They were not about to welcome me back home. They wanted me gone and as far away from Moscow as possible.
So I stayed in the hands of the Americans and they had no idea what do with me. To put me on a trial would mean to confess how close we were to a nuclear war and a total annihilation.
Given the chance, I would point the finger to our dear friends in the Kremlin, saying I was under official orders. 
That would have been a beatiful mess and would almost certainly lead to further unrest and war.
It was in everyone's interest that I did not talk. They decided to tuck me away here on Malden.
Not on an American or Soviet territory, thus not being a liability, they were happy to let me rot away.

Fortunately, they did not expect my loyal friends to attack and set me free. I am thankful to all of you, once again. I am finally back!

So, there is no bomb?
A story we made up to get you on board.
Two years ago, our spies got access to secret archives in Leningrad and they found out about the deal between us and the Americans about comrade Livanokh.
We wanted to get to Malden and free him. To achieve that, we could not have chosen a better person. Your knowledge of both the enemy and the battlefield made you invaluable to our plans.
You were also the last one to see comrade Livanokh before his captivity.

documents about the dealofficial version si that the Americans killed Livanokh

We were like brothers, after all, and brothers do not betray each other!
I lost my brother the moment you decided to start a world war!
I always knew you woudn't understand. You are short-sighted, even now, you still don't get that my plan is the only way for this world to move forward.

You used to trust me, 

You know our country is dying. What will replace it? What will happen when only a single superpower remains? 
Every 

After all we've been through, you could not just end me there and there. Perhaps subconsciously 


I had to spent months in the hospital in near death state, but I did survive, because you have failed.

You were still torn whether killing me was the only way to stop me, I reckon. After all we've been through, you could not simply 
 you were unable to end me there and there.
And now, I am back.
You've been here all this time?


; Part 3
; Zubarev arrives in Chapoi and kills Shaposhnikov
; Chernikov informs Belsky, Belsky calls out to others - for Shaposhnikov this is too late

I'll be over at Cancon. You'll take care of things here in Le Port, all right, Belsky?
Understood, comrade Chernikov. You can count on me.

Shit, shit, shit! Come on, come on, work!

Hm, it seems Zubarev is coming for a visit. Check the radio, Anton, maybe something's up.
Right away, sir.

Code red, code red! They've got Lemontov and they know about us! They're coming for you!
Fuck!

Comrade Zubarev, what brings you here?
Shaposhnikov, I truly hate traitors.

Kill them all.
