; Kaplinsky intervenes and takes Lemontov to a car, Dyaconsen disappears

Take some men and secure this hangar, Kaplinsky. I'll check the other one.
Yes, comrade Lemontov.
Vasily, Artyom, come here!

So it really is true. You are leading them.
George? Is that you?
In the flesh. I told you we would meet again. I was hoping it would be under different circumstances...
I'm still bound by my orders and my loyalty, but I presume you already figured everything out.
They told me, that's why I'm here.
I said it before and I'll say it again - I am sorry.
You thought it was a good idea to keep it a secret from me? Even though I lived next door for years?
I had orders I had to follow, no matter how much I disagreed. And I still do. I think we made a terrible mistake.
I concur. I can see it's not in here, that's clear. Tell me where you hid it, I need to destroy it.
It? Interesting. Is that your way of coping nowadays?
Cut the crap, George, the others are right behind me and we haven't got much time. Tell me where it is.
Whatever you call it, my orders are to not let you through.
Is this what the last eight years led to? Do you want this to end with us gunning each other down in a fucking hangar?
We are still on the other side of the barricade. I warned you this would happen.
Just leave, George, get back to Malden. I'll handle the bomb, then take over the army and leave this whole area for good.
A bomb? What are you...
Comarade Lemontov, we need to go!
Get out of here, George...
Grigory, wait, I...
They're coming, go!
But...
Go, for fuck's sake!
Comrade Lemontov?
What is it, Kaplinsky?
Comrade Volkov is requesting our presence. In the eastern base.
What?
He'll explain everything. A car is waiting for us, come with me.

; Livanokh and Lemontov discussion
; Lemontov taken prisoner

Comrade Lemontov, so nice of you to join us.
What is going on? How are you all here?
We'll explain everything, comrade Lemontov, everything. But first, comrade Kaplinsky?
Drop your weapon, comrade Lemontov.
What are you doing?
Disarming you, comrade. The weapon, drop it.
What the fuck is the meaning of this? Have you gone mad?
We are so close to victory, I had it all under control. Let me get back to the hangars and...
No need. You are exactly where you are supposed to be.
Traitors.
You are surrounded, Lemontov. Drop your gun, or would you rather be shot?
I am quick enough to take one down with me. Care to volunteer, Zubarev?
I would like to see you try.
Don't test me.
Gentlemen, please, there is no need for this. Let's keep this civilized.
Drop your weapon, comrade Lemontov, there is no room for you to get out of this. 
We don't want to kill you...
Not yet...
... if we wanted you dead we've had plenty of opportunity before.
We have matters to discuss and believe you me, you will want to hear what is about to be said.
Shit.
Good, let us proceed. We are secure!
No, no, no, no... not possible. Not real. It can't be... It must not...
