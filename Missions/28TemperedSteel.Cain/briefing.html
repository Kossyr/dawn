   <b>17th December 1987</b> - the <a href="#Report">report</a> does not favour us.
   <br><br>
   The enemy is many and we are few. I can't say we are under-equipped - quite the opposite. But we don't have many men - only four infantry squads, a tank platoon and one air squadron plus the engineers for the minefields. Most of our forces are in the central hills and further to the north. This will be a long day.
   <br><br>
   I personally scouted the enemy positions this morning. They are well entrenched but our orders are simple - break through and seize the Neva base. We can't utilise <a href="marker:Valley">the valley</a> as this was the direction of the attack that cost us central Kolguyev two weeks back. It led to further defeats and our last stand before the reinforcements arrived. The command does not wish to see that situation repeated and we are forbidden from going through there. That means we have to advance along the coast.
   <br><br>
   I have been given four infantry squads, a tank platoon and two helicopters. The enemy has forts, machine guns, mines, Anti-Air and Anti-Tank guns and tanks. What does the command expect of me I do not know, but this is a very risky attack. At least we have air superiority - but using that requires destroying enemy Anti-Air. And doing that cannot be done without tanks. And tanks cannot get to the base without infantry.
   <br><br>
   So that's how I've come with this plan. The infantry attacks the fortified checkpoints on the road, clearing all the mines. The engineers have come straight from Moscow and they're supposed to be fast - I certainly hope so. I'll take command of them myself and provide them with cover. Once we clear both minefields, the tanks can get through and we attack the Neva base. The main objective should be to make a breakthrough and at the same time to look for those Anti-Air guns and get rid of them. We will not be able to seize the base and hold it without air support.
   <br><br>
   Vadim seems to believe in me. Everyone seems to believe in me. The plan was approved instantly and I have been given a great freedom in deciding who goes where. I just have to trust my own plan and that it will carry me through the day. Failure is not an option.

<b>Enemy forces</b>
<br><br>
The enemy had a lot of time to prepare. There are two ways to advance on the <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a>: from the north through the <a href="marker:Valley">valley</a> and from the northeast along the <a href="marker:Start">coast</a>. The <a href="marker:Valley">valley</a> is off limits so this report will only detail the coastal defences.
<br><br>
The road is guarded by two fortified checkpoints - at <a href="marker:MineField1">Gc54</a> and at <a href="marker:MineField2">Gb56</a>. There are also mines set up to stop armoured vehicles. The forts are manned mostly by infantry, although there have been sightings of APCs in the area. The fortifications themselves are rather light and can be broken through with just infantry.
<br><br>
Access to the <a href="marker:Base">base</a> is guarded by <a href="marker:Fortifications">heavy fortifications</a>. Expect forts, machine gun nests, tanks, patrols and AT guns. 
<br><br>
The <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a> itself is crawling with infantry. There have also been sightings of Anti-Air guns - at least three of them. They change positions frequently and we were unable to pinpoint their location this morning. You'll have to spot them yourselves and subsequently destroy them.
<br><br>
There are enemy <a href="marker:Reserves">reserves</a> in the back. They mostly watch the <a href="marker:Valley">valley</a> and will not probably react until they know for sure our main attack is along the coast. By the time you enter the <a href="marker:Base">base</a>, they will be on their way. Expect infantry and tanks.
<br><br>
<b>Our forces</b>
<br><br>
Several groups were assigned to the task of breaking through the enemy positions and seizing the <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a>. 
<br>
<b>Infantry</b> - There are four infantry squads conducting the main attack - Leonid, Anton, Boris and Roman. Leonid is ten men strong while the others are twelve men strong, comprising of machine gunners, AT soldiers, grenadiers and each squad having a medic. Additionally, three expert engineers from Moscow are also present with tasks of disabling the enemy minefields.
<br>
<b>Tanks</b> - A tank group <a href="marker:Yuri">Yuri</a> is waiting further along the road. It is comprised of two T-80s, T72 and BMP. It will advance behind the infantry and then attack together with them on the <a href="marker:Fortifications">fortifications</a> and the <a href="marker:Base">base</a>.
<br>
<b>Air support</b> - Squadron <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> is waiting in Malsk and will support the main attack when called in. They possess two attack helicopters of type Mi-24. The concern for them is the three enemy Anti-Air guns. We recommend taking them out before calling in the squadron.

      With the control of central Kolguyev firmly in our hands it is time to secure our flanks. Our main offensive will be happening in the north while you will lead the operation in the south. The target is the <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a>.
   <br><br>
   This time it is forbidden to advance through the <a href="marker:Valley">valley</a>, instead seizing the coastal road. The enemy is well prepared and fortified. You have limited resources at your disposal, try to utilise them to the best of your abilities.
   <br><br>
   There are four infantry squads comprising the attack group - Leonid, Anton, Boris and Roman. Additionally, tank group <a href="marker:Yuri">Yuri</a> and air force <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> are awaiting your signal.
   <br><br>
	You start with other attack groups <a href="marker:Start">on the road</a> close to the enemy positions.

   <p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Firstly, gather your units. The enemy has two sets of minefields on the road to the base - at <a href="marker:MineField1">Gc54</a> and at <a href="marker:MineField2">Gb56</a>. To let our tanks through you have to deal with these mines first. For that a group of engineers shall join you and take care of it. Your objective is to get them close and cover them.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Attack and seize the fortified positions around the <a href="marker:MineField1">first minefield</a>. Deactivate all the mines there.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Continue to the fortified positions around the <a href="marker:MineField2">second minefield</a>. Deactivate all the mines there.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Advance towards your main target: the <a href="marker:Fortifications">fortifications</a> and the <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a>. When you're ready, give the signal to attack groups and tank group <a href="marker:Yuri">Yuri</a> to attack.</p>
  <hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Break through the enemy <a href="marker:Fortifications">fortifications</a>.</p>
  <hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_6"></a>Locate and destroy the enemy Anti-Air guns which are somewhere around the <a href="marker:Base">base</a>.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_7"></a>Call in air support to assist you ideally when you've dealt with the enemy Anti-Air guns.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_8"></a>Seize the <a href="marker:Base">Neva base</a>. Repel enemy <a href="marker:Reserves">reserves</a>.</p>

    <p>You did well, comrade. It was a difficult task, but you prevailed. With this kind of tactical and strategic thinking you just reserved yourself a spot at all planning tables and a certain promotion. Excellent work, comrade commander!</p>
