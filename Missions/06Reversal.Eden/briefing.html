<b>7th November 1987</b> - It's not looking good. We are pushing again towards Montignac but it costs us a lot and the enemy is still superior I find. Command believes this offensive will finally break them, but I am not so sure if we don't break first...

An offensive to end the war and push the enemy off the island starts this morning.
<br><br>
The main offensive target is the city of <a href="marker:Montignac">Montignac</a>. You are a part of the eastern front which serves as a decoy. You shall attack first and make the enemy believe our main push will be in the east, meanwhile we will strike from the west and in the centre.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">here</a>, very near the enemy positions.
</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Attack and seize a <a href="marker:Farm">small farm</a> together with squads <a href="marker:boris">Boris</a> and <a href="marker:Leonid">Leonid</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Wait for the tanks from squad <a href="marker:Fyodor">Fyodor</a> to arrive, they will take you and squad Boris towards your second objective - the village of <a href="marker:EntreDeux">Entre Deux</a>. Leonid will meanwhile seize the <a href="marker:Base">coastal base</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>The enemy has fortified a <a href="marker:Scout">hill</a> which you will have to break through before you can attack the village itself.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Seize the enemy village of <a href="marker:EntreDeux">Entre Deux</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Retreat back to <a href="marker:Provins">Provins</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Debriefing:End1">Mission completed?</a></h2>
<br>
<p>The decoy plan was a failure as the enemy has outflanked us and obliterated our western front. Our push towards Entre Deux did not mean anything then. A general retreat has been declared as our position is no longer sustainable. Get as fast as you can to Saint Pierre, comrade!</p>
