<b>6th December 1988</b> - We got up early this morning. Our goal - reconnaissance. We need to know what the enemy is planning. The easiest is to have a look. 
<br><br>
I've seen Lemontov when they woke us up. We only exchanged looks before he disappeared in the morning mist. He's in forward positions deep behind enemy lines. Life of spetsnaz - always exciting.

Today's objective is to scout enemy positions. The two main targets are <a href="marker:baseDeer">Malsk</a> in the north and <a href="marker:baseTortoise">the Dnieper base</a> in the south. The enemy has set up a number of forward camps in the hills so you'll have to fight your way through. Your squad Roman is heading to the <a href="marker:EllipseArea">northern sector</a> and <a href="marker:baseDeer">Malsk</a>, meanwhile squad Konstantin handles the <a href="marker:EllipseArea2">southern sector</a> and the <a href="marker:baseTortoise">Dnieper base</a>.
<br>
Squad Dmitry is in <a href="marker:EllipseLemontov">forward position</a> and is also the leader of this operation.
<br><br>
Mission starts at the <a href="marker:start">Don base</a>.
