STRM_18v01,"What were you thinking, Zubarev?",lemontov
STRM_18v02,"What the hell were you thinking when you gave that order?",lemontov
STRM_18v03,"It was an opportunity and I took it, Lemontov!",Zubarev
STRM_18v04,"Opportunity for what? We had barely enough men to hold that territory, let alone take it!",lemontov
STRM_18v05,"I... I may have undertaken a small risk, but victory would give us...",Zubarev
STRM_18v06,"Nothing! We would just have to defend more territory with fewer men!",lemontov
STRM_18v07,"The offensive was a partial success as the enemy suffered losses...",Zubarev
STRM_18v08,"We took out a few of their light tanks and seized one base. Bloody well done.",lemontov
STRM_18v09,"Don't ridicule me, Lemontov! As if you would have done any better!",Zubarev
STRM_18v10,"I told you, Zubarev, that we have to be on the defensive.\nWe are outnumbered and have to fight the enemy in rough terrain, that is our only advantage!",lemontov
STRM_18v11,"The great Russian bear does not sit idly in the hills while the enemy surrounds him!\nOur attack today delayed them and made them change their plans! They will have to rebuild...",Zubarev
STRM_18v12,"No, you lost us central Kolguyev today, that's what you did!",lemontov
STRM_18v13,"Comrades, please. The whole camp can hear you arguing. It's not good for the morale.",lemontov
STRM_18v14a,"I'm done talking anyway. You know Lemontov, I am not sure why Volkov even allowed you back in the army.\nYou lack vision ever since Livanokh's death and that prison time hasn't done you any good.",Zubarev
STRM_18v14b,"Once Volkov arrives I'll personally request you to be stripped of your rank and sent back to Russia.",zubarev
STRM_18v15,"Pompous prick. Why is he in command here again?",lemontov
STRM_18v16,"Is that a rhetorical question?",Shaposhnikov
STRM_18v17,"Volkov's right hand man, I know. After the latest debacle though I'm not sure what his role is anymore.",lemontov
STRM_18v18,"He's still in charge at least until Volkov gets back.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_18v19,"But it's up to us to clean up this mess. And how the hell are we going to do that?",Lemontov
STRM_18v20,"The next enemy offensive might push up to Saragorod before we can stop it. If at all.",Lemontov
STRM_18v21,"We're going to have to improvise, Grigory. Let's recon a bit, see what the enemy is planning. Then we can make a counter move.",Shaposhnikov

STRM_18v22,"The last offensive didn't go so well I've been told. You hear anything, Sergey?",yashin
STRM_18v23,"I've seen the plan and the reports. The assault was too ambitious and risky and the tanks were not given enough support.\nWe can be glad we didn't lose more.",rashiv
STRM_18v24,"But what do we do now? We're holding less than half the island. Are any reinforcements coming, comrade captain?",yashin
STRM_18v25,"I am not at liberty to comment on that, comrade Yashin.",shaposhnikov
STRM_18v26,"We'll know when they arrive, Igor. For now we can only fight on. Heads up, we're entering enemy territory.",rashiv
STRM_18v27,"You're starting to sound more and more like a commander, you know that Rashiv?",shaposhnikov
STRM_18v28,"I learned from the best, comrade Shaposhnikov.",rashiv

STRM_18v29,"Holy shit, that is a lot of tanks. We can't hope to hold this!",rashiv
