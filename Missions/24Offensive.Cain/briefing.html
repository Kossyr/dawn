<b>12 December 1988</b> - Day nine of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
I don't have much time, we're moving out in a few moments. We are once again the spearhead for this operation. I'm hoping to gain command of my own tank platoon, but so far I'm still waiting. They did promote me to captain, but that didn't change a thing. I hope it's going to be soon. It must be. I deserve my own platoon. I will have it.
<br><br>
We're returning to central Kolguyev today. I recognize it around here pretty well - it's been only a week since I fought for the Motherland for the first time here. We're back now and stronger than ever. We will crush that western vermin once for all.
<br><br>
The platoon is ready. Comrade Syomin had a passionate speech about the offensive. I felt proud of my nation as I chanted along the others. For the Mortherland!

It is time to return to central Kolguyev, comrade Kukushkin.
<br><br>
Your squad Yuri is the main spearhead in this offensive. First, break through a small enemy <a href="marker:Fortifications">forward fortifications</a> and advance on the <a href="marker:FirstBase">Dnieper base</a>. Several squads of infantry will support your advance from the <a href="marker:Infantry1">north</a> and <a href="marker:Infantry2">south</a>. 
<br><br>
The next target is <a href="marker:SecondBase">Astrabirsk</a>, in this attack paratrooper regiments should help you from the forests in <a href="marker:Paratroopers1">this</a> and <a href="marker:Paratroopers2">this</a> general direction. 
<br><br>
The last objective is <a href="marker:ThirdBase">the Irtysh base</a>. The enemy should be weakened from the operations of our Spetsnaz forces this morning, but be on a lookout for enemy reinforcements.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">near the front lines</a>.
