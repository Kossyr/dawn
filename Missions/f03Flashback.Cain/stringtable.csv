-- Intro

Comrade Lemontov, comrade Livanokh arrived during the night. He wishes for you to come see him immediately.
I thought I made it clear I wanted to be informed of comrade Livanokh's arrival the moment he arrived.
Comrade Livanokh specifically asked me not to wake you up. I was supposed to wait for you here.
He also went to sleep, comrade, he was tired after the journey.
Fair enough. Get some rest, private, I can get to the villa myself.
Thank you, comrade Lemontov! You can take my car if you wish!

Sasha finally arrived. That must mean he is ready to give the signal. The waiting is over. Finally.
It's still somewhat early, I need to make sure everything's ready before I go to the villa.
I should check with Kuznetsov about the supply status. Hopefully there are no lingering issues.
And Vadim was supposed to return yesterday and I haven't seen him yet. I should change that.
The others are probably in the command centre already awaiting the order. They shall not wait long.

-- Entrance to villa

As expected, there they are. I can check with them before going in.

Comrade major Lemontov, welcome. Comrade Livanokh is expecting you. He's upstairs in his office.

I have something to take care of first. I'll be right back.

At ease, comrade. I'm going in.


-- Livanokh
