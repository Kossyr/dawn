-- Intro

Comrade Lemontov, comrade Livanokh arrived during the night. He wishes for you to come see him immediately.
I thought I made it clear I wanted to be informed of comrade Livanokh's arrival the moment he arrived.
Comrade Livanokh specifically asked me not to wake you up. I was supposed to wait for you here.
He also went to sleep, comrade, he was tired after the journey.
Fair enough. Get some rest, comrade, I can get to the villa myself.
Thank you, comrade Lemontov! Feel free to take my car!

-- Probably not
Sasha finally arrived. That must mean he is ready to give the signal. The waiting is over. Finally.
It's still somewhat early, I need to make sure everything's ready before I go to the villa.
I should check with Kuznetsov about the supply status. Hopefully he fixed all the issues.
The others are probably in the command centre already awaiting the order. They shall not wait long.
--

Comrade Lemontov, welcome!
Where is comrade Kuznetsov?
At the base, comrade, handling the supplies.
Good. At ease, comrades, and carry on.

-- Kuznetsov
Be careful with the heavy crates and leave the barrels for the next truck, we're already late as it is!
Comrade Kuznetsov, report!
Comrade Lemontov, we've been hauling since the very first light! Most of the crates are on the ships, we're mostly missing oil.
And what's all this?
Food, camp equipment, tools and other small goods. Most of the weapons and ammunition are already loaded.
Oil is always a problem. Where is the last shipment?
It should have arrived in the northern ports, but so far I have not received confirmation. I will go check it out myself.
How long is the current cargo going to last?
Four days easily, six days at maximum.
That should be enough for our first campaign. Make sure it's ready by evening.
Today? So we are going in?
We are not sure, but i's possible. Comrade Livanokh arrived and he very well might give the signal. You haven't heard?
No, comrade, we were too busy to notice.
Alright, do your part and make sure all the essentials are ready.
I will not disappoint you, comrade Lemontov!
As long as it's in your capable hands I do not worry.
-- Hasn't seen Rashiv
Tell me, has Rashiv returned?
Yes, comrade, already yesterday. He should be on the coast overlooking the loading process.
I might pay him a visit.
--
Carry on, comrade Kuzentsov.
At your orders, comrade Lemontov!


-- Dostoevsky
Comrade Lemontov, nice of you to visit!
Comrade Dostoevsky, I'm looking for comrade Rashiv.
He's over there, keeping an eye on the port.
I've heard rumours. Are we going in, comrade Lemontov?
That is to be determined. Make sure your men are ready though.
We have been waiting for this moment for months, comrade, our troops are ready and eager!
Good to hear, comrade Dostoevsky. I'm going to talk to comrade Rashiv, carry on.
Towards victory, comrade Lemontov!

-- Rashiv
Good morning Grigory, it's good to see you.
Hello, Vadim, likewise. Is everything in order?
The supplies are getting loaded and the troops are getting ready. Few hurdles here and there but nothing unexpected.
Have you been summoned?
Yes.
So this is it. We are about to start the war.
Highly likely, yes. Probably this very night.
Then hopefully your plan is going to work. We don't have enough supplies to last a week. It will need to be quick and smooth.
It will be, we hold all the advanteges. Is there anything essential that you are missing?
Mostly oil for the trucks. Kuznetsov is supposed to take care of that.
-- Seen Kuznetsov
He's handling it. What about the troops?
-- HJasn't seen Kuznetsov
I'll check with him. What about the troops?
--
The morale is high and the equipment in place. We are fully supplied and combat-ready, even if for only a week.
As long as we have surprise on our side, we cannot lose on Everon.
It's not Everon I am worried about.
Yes, Malden will be a worthy battle indeed. Still, the current situation favours us. It all depends how fast can the Americans mobilize their reserves and if we get more supplies in.
After Everon, the mainland will support our incursion and we'll get everything we need.
But that's all for the future. I'm going over to the villa, I'll see you at the commanders' meeting.
You won't even ask?
Alright, how was the mainland?
Excellent, thank you for asking. Sergey grew a lot - I hardly recognized him. It's been wonderful two weeks, just him and me.
You know, if not for the children and our families - what would we even be fighting for? They are the only thing that matters in the end.
Certainly.
Have you thought about raising your own children, Grigory?
Not at all, actually.
You should. I think you're missing out on a lot.
I'm not the family type. Besides, my life is not suited for that kind of thing. I hardly get back to the mainland as it is.
Don't you feel like something's missing? That you don't have anyone close to you that you would want to protect? 
Who whould wait for you and welcome you when you get back? Whom you would snuggle with during long winter nights?
Are we still talking about children?
Children and women come in a package - you can't have one without the other.
You've never thought even about that? I'm not talking marriage, just a relationship that only a man and a woman can have.
This discussion is over. I need to go anyway.
We'll get back to this, don't worry. Give my regards to Alexander. Take care, Grigory.
See you later, Vadim.


-- Officers (Blonsky, Volkov, Frolov)
Comrade Volkov, comrade Blonsky and comrade Frolov, what brings you here in this early hour?

-- Entrance to villa

As expected, there they are. I can check with them before going in.

Comrade major Lemontov, welcome. Comrade Livanokh is expecting you. He's upstairs in his office.

-- Livanokh
