COMMENT,"-------------------",
STRM_f03v52,"The morale is high and the equipment in place. We are fully supplied and combat-ready.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v53,"As long as we have surprise on our side, we cannot lose on Everon.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v54,"It's not Everon I am worried about.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v55,"Yes, Malden will be a worthy battle indeed. Still, the current situation favours us.\nIt all depends how fast can the Americans mobilize their reserves and if we are able to get supplies in.",Comment
STRM_f03v56,"After Everon, the mainland will support our incursion and we'll get everything we need.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v57,"But that's all for the future. I'm going over to the villa, I'll see you at the command centre.",Lemontov

STRM_f03v58,"I spoke to Katya.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v59,"She contacted you?",Lemontov
STRM_f03v60,"She did. I guess I'm the only means she has of getting to you.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v61,"She misses you, you know. She hasn't seen you for...",Rashiv
STRM_f03v62,"For years, I'm aware. I've been busy.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v63,"Even you don't believe that.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v64,"She's safe and wants for nothing. What more can one ask for?",Lemontov
STRM_f03v65,"We both know it's you she lacks. Why don't you ever even visit?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v66,"Get your nose out of my business, Vadim. I regret I ever told you about my private life.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v67,"You were as drunk as a lord, otherwise you would have never confided even in your best friend.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v68,"You pretend you don't care but you guard her like a treasure, yet at the same time keep her at a distance.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v69,"Are you really doing this to protect her or are you simply afraid of a family life?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v70,"I'm not the type. Soldiery is what I understand.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v71,"You can lie to me, Grigory, I don't care, but don't lie to yourself!",Rashiv
STRM_f03v72,"The last few weeks I spent with Sergey, the time when it's just him and me, even if only a few times a year - that's what drives me forward, keeps me going.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v73,"The home you can return to, the children and the family that await you - that's what we are fighting for.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v74,"They are the only thing that matters in the end. Deep down you understand that too, although you're afraid to admit it.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v110,"As much as I would love for this discussion to continue, I need to go.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v111,"Tell me one last thing - does Alexander know?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v112,"I never discussed it with him, no. He has his own personal tragedy to deal with.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v113,"I see. We'll get back to this, don't worry. Someone has to make you see reason.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v114,"See you later Vadim.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v115,"Take care, Grigory.",Rashiv
