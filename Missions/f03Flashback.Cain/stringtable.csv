STRM_f03v43,"Have you been summoned?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v44,"Yes.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v45,"So this is it. We are about to start the war.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v46,"Highly likely, yes. Probably this very night.",Lemontov

STRM_f03v48,"It will be, we hold all the advanteges. Is there anything essential that you are missing?",Lemontov

STRM_f03v53,"As long as we have surprise on our side, we cannot lose on Everon.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v54,"It's not Everon I am worried about.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v55,"Yes, Malden will be a worthy battle indeed. Still, the current situation favours us. It all depends how fast can the Americans mobilize their reserves and if we get more supplies in.",Comment
STRM_f03v56,"After Everon, the mainland will support our incursion and we'll get everything we need.",Lemontov

STRM_f03v58,"You won't even ask?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v59,"Alright, how was the mainland?",Lemontov

STRM_f03v61,"You know, if not for the children and our families - what would we even be fighting for? They are the only thing that matters in the end.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v62,"Certainly.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v63,"Have you thought about raising your own children, Grigory?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v64,"Not at all, actually.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v65,"You should. I think you're missing out on a lot.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v66,"I'm not the family type. Besides, my life is not suited for that kind of thing. I hardly get back to the mainland as it is.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v67,"Don't you feel like something's missing? That you don't have anyone close to you that you would want to protect? ",Rashiv
STRM_f03v68,"Who whould wait for you and welcome you when you get back? Whom you would snuggle with during long winter nights?",Rashiv
STRM_f03v69,"Are we still talking about children?",Lemontov
STRM_f03v70,"Children and women come in a package - you can't have one without the other.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v71,"You've never thought even about that? I'm not talking marriage, just a relationship that only a man and a woman can have.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v72,"This discussion is over. I need to go anyway.",Lemontov
STRM_f03v73,"We'll get back to this, don't worry. Give my regards to Alexander. Take care, Grigory.",Rashiv
STRM_f03v74,"See you later, Vadim.",Lemontov

STRM_f03v98,"So, the plan stands. And after, Malden?",Lemontov
