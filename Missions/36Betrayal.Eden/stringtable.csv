STRM_ONLOAD_INTRO,"Montignac","",On load intro

STRM_36v01,"Enjoying the view?","",lemontov
STRM_36v02,"Very much, actually. Montignac is a beautiful city after all - the island's capital and its prized jewel.\nAnd it only took us two days to capture it.","",zubarev
STRM_36v03,"Certainly better than the last time.","",lemontov
STRM_36v04,"True. Let us not beat around the bush any longer. I don't wish to insult your intelligence, Lemontov.\nYou must have long figured out the first attack was just a small nudge, testing the waters, so to speak.\nTo see if NATO would take the bait.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v05,"I did suspect as much.","",lemontov
STRM_36v06,"Of course you did. It was blatantly obvious. Although it did get past all those idiots in Kremlin.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v07,"You speak very brazenly.","",lemontov
STRM_36v08,"We are far from the central government, Lemontov. We are more free than others. Free to pursue our own goals.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v09,"Tensions around here have been rising for years.\nAlthough Kremlin reduced the Kolguyev garrison significantly, we were still numerous enough to cause trouble to the Americans.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v10,"We kept showing off our strength. Missile tests and naval trainings were always short distance from Everon.\nOur air force entered the enemy air space ever so slighty on several occasions.\nIt was enough to send a signal.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v11,"Everon's leadership got scared.\nThey expected us to attack any moment - which we were considering -\nand broke the old peace treaty by inviting the Americans to their island.\nThe dice were cast.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v12,"We weren't actually strong enough to take Everon at the time and we did not even try.\nRetreating to Kolguyev was always part of the plan.\nWe had to look weak so that we would receive the resources we required.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v13,"But even when the enemy marched on Kolguyev, Kremlin lost balls.\nI had to make sure our situation weas truly hopeless for them to finally budge.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v14,"The attack in central Kolguyev... You groveling before Volkov... all this time, your incompetence was just a play?","",lemontov
STRM_36v15,"I thought you would see through it. It brings me joy to know I managed to deceive the great Grigory Lemontov.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v16,"A great feat indeed. Tell me then, what do you need this army for?","",lemontov
STRM_36v17,"You are aware, of course, that Everon is not our final goal. This story does not end here. It is Malden and it has always been Malden.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v18,"But what is there I am not at liberty to disclose at the moment. Follow us and you shall find out for yourself eventually.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v19,"Now, I laid my cards on the table so that you are aware of the situation and who you are dealing with.\nCome in, we need to discuss the next phase.","",zubarev

STRM_36v20,"I'm going to go straight to the point. The rebel commander, Gaston, came to us and requested our help.\nApparently, a lot of their men were captured - including their second in command, one Poincare.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v21,"We found where they are held. Your task is to join forces with the rebels and help them reclaim those prisoners.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v22,"Sounds easy enough.","",lemontov
STRM_36v23,"That's not all. Once you rescue them, kill them.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v24,"They are relentless, they fight for their ideals no matter the opposition and they shall never stop. \nThey are a hindrance and a dangerous one at that.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v25,"Either we deal with them now or they are going to cause us problems in the long run.\nExecuting their highest command should do the trick.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v26,"So you wish to screw over them the second time?\nAnd again hiding behind the mask of friendship while stabbing them in the back?","",lemontov
STRM_36v27,"You tried to deal with them in the past and look how that turned out. You failed to get rid of their leaders, that's where you erred.\nBut we've got both of them in once place this time.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v28,"And friends? Please. Temporary co-belligerents is more likely.\nThey will turn on us the moment NATO is gone. We shall just turn on them first.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v29,"It's one thing to defeat them in battle. It's another to slaughter them like animals when they can't even defend themselves.","",lemontov
STRM_36v30,"You are deceiving yourself if you think this is any more different than what you did seven years ago with Livanokh.\nI'm just asking you to finish the job you already started.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v31,"Look, Lemontov, this order came straight from comrade Volkov and it's not up for discussion.\nHe wants you to do it personally.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v32,"What's the position of Kremlin on this?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v33,"You would have to ask them yourself.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v34,"I take it they did not sanction it then.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v35,"For fuck's sake, Lemontov, of course not! Don't play stupid! Kremlin has no power here!\nOn this island, my word is as much worth as that of the General Secretary!\nHere, you only answer to me.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v36,"Still need convincing? You know, I am long looking for an excuse to put a bullet in your head. Will you give me one?","",Zubarev
STRM_36v37,"I'll do it, of course. I listen and obey, comrade Zubarev.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v38,"As you should. A meeting with the rebels, tomorrow morning here. Don't be late. Dismissed!","",Zubarev

STRM_36v39,"Piece of shit... Volkov's yes man, my ass. He played me like a fiddle. Zubarev is not a bumbling idiot, I am the idiot!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v40,"What kind of mess did I get myself into? What the fuck do I do?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v41,"Grigory! Hey, Grigory!","",Rashiv
STRM_36v42,"Sergei! What happened to you to end up in the hospital?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v43,"Le Moule happened. Tough fight. We almost had to retreat but an ace pilot saved our asses. What about you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v44,"Hm? Me? Yeah, I'm alright. Sergei, listen, something terrible is about to happen.\n The rebels need our help rescuing their comrades from prison.\nWe are to provide assistance tomorrow.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v45,"That's terrible how?","",rashiv
STRM_36v46,"We are to... execute them right after.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v47,"Wh...What?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v48,"Zubarev just told me. Apparently, a direct order from Volkov. They want to finish the Everon resistance for good.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v49,"Well, you're not going to do it, are you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v50,"What am I supposed to do? It's a direct order.\nIf I don't do it, they find someone else and I'm going straight in front of the firing squad!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v51,"Grigory, you cannot do this!","",rashiv
STRM_36v52,"I must do it! Do you not understand?!","",lemontov
STRM_36v53,"They are our allies!\nThey've been fighting for their lifes, for their freedom for years - and you're going to slaughter them like animals?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v54,"What other choice do I have, Sergei?","",lemontov
STRM_36v55,"You can choose not to do it!","",rashiv
STRM_36v56,"Then it's my head on the chopping block! How does that solve anything!?","",lemontov
STRM_36v57,"This classifies as a war crime! Orders like this have to go through the Politburo.","",Rashiv
STRM_36v58,"Sergei, open your eyes. The government has no sway in here. Volkov and Zubarev are calling all the shots.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v59,"What about making our move then? What about we march in and shoot down Zubarev, Volkov and all the others?\nTake matters into our own hands.","",rashiv
STRM_36v60,"That's folly. Volkov isn't even here! The army will see us as mutineers and traitors.\nWe would be lucky to even get close to Zubarev.\nNo, this is not yet the time to strike.","",lemontov
STRM_36v61,"It's always waiting with you, Grigory!\nWe are still waiting, still biding our time, still expecting some new information to shed a light on the fact we are completele fucked.\nWhen is it going to be the time to act?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v62,"We would die pointless deaths if we are not ready. It will not be on Everon, Sergei.","",lemnontov
STRM_36v63,"So you're waiting for Malden then. Expecting the grand reveal of their goal to solve everything?\nAnd you're willing to let the rebels die for it?","",rashiv
STRM_36v64,"This is not what I would have wanted, but if that's what it takes - yes.","",lemontov
STRM_36v65,"I cannot believe this. I fought with them, Grigory. They saved my life!","",rashiv
STRM_36v66,"I am sorry, Sergei, buyt if it is choosing between saving them and the world then there is no choice!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v67,"I've never been this disappointed.\nI thought you were better, Grigory.\nIf you must do it, so be it, but don't come anywhere near me ever again.","",rashiv
STRM_36v68,"Sergei! Sergei?!","",lemontov

STRM_36v69,"Your car is ready, comrade major. Good luck!","",soldier

STRM_36v70,"Didn't get any sleep and the weather's shit. Great.","",lemontov
STRM_36v71,"What am I even doing? What am I going to do?","",lemontov
STRM_36v72,"Executing the rebels... Fuck. What can I do against orders though? Zubarev was clear: it's my head or theirs.","",lemontov
STRM_36v73,"It's one thing is to kill in a war, another is to stab in the back. Like some underhanded rogue.\nThe worst kind of a two-faced shakal.","",lemontov
STRM_36v74,"Is there a way to save them? Hardly, I'm going to be watched by my own team.\nKaplinsky probably has strict orders - if I let them go, I'm going to get a bullet in the back of my head.","",lemontov
STRM_36v75,"This is so shit! I feel so powerless. A murder is about to happen and I am to be the main perpetrator. And I can't do anything about it.","",lemontov
STRM_36v76,"I must stop Volkov and Zubarev from reaching their goal on Malden. Do I have to become a war criminal to do that?","",lemontov
STRM_36v77,"What would Vadim do in my stead? What would Sergei do?","",lemontov
STRM_36v78,"Too bad I can't ask either of them. It's just me in a pit of snakes. Fuck. This is going to be a long day.","",lemontov

STRM_36v80,"Hey, that's comrade Lemontov!","",somebody
STRM_36v81,"Good morning, comrade major!","",somebody
STRM_36v82,"Salutations, comrade.","",somebody
STRM_36v83,"My name is getting around. Stas did his work.","",lemontov
STRM_36v84,"I can't throw that away. I've come too far to fail. I need to see this through to the end.","",lemontov
STRM_36v85,"No matter the price!","",lemontov

STRM_36v86,"Comrade major, we've been waiting for you. Our squad is ready. This is Gaston Astier and his people. They understand English.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v87,"You truly do give us your best. After your performance at our castle, I'm looking forward to working with you, Lemontov.","",astier
STRM_36v88,"Likewise. Let's get to it. What do we have?","",lemontov
STRM_36v89,"The prisoners are kept at a coastal base in the east. There are two roads leading there.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v90,"A mechanized squad is preparing to attack Entre Deux. We can go with them to open up a gateway to the area.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v91,"We should avoid the southern front and large bases, otherwise it shouldn't be an issue. We are ready to go if you are.","",kaplinsky

STRM_36v92,"I'm taking the rebels with me. You join the attack on Entre Deux and then get ready to join us at the base. I'll give you the signal.","",lemontov
STRM_36v93,"I'm not sure, comrade major, I have my orders...","",Kaplinsky
STRM_36v94,"I have mine too. This is the best way to fulfill them.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v95,"I think I understand, comrade. Very well, we're going in on your signal.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v96,"What's the plan?","",astier
STRM_36v97,"You're going to follow me. First stop is Entre Deux, then your friends.","",lemontov
STRM_36v98,"Hold on, who says we want to follow your orders? My men will not like it.","",astier
STRM_36v99,"Listen here, Gaston, and listen well. You will follow and you will obey.\nYou are not on the best terms with our command.\nYou do what I say and we are all going to be happy at the end of this. Got it?","",lemontov
STRM_36v100,"Our position is indeed bad if we have to ask the Soviets for any help. But I do hold you in higher regard than most of your countrymen.\nVery well, we're going with you.","",astier
STRM_36v101,"We follow Lemontov!","",astier

STRM_36v102,"Let's get moving then. Kaplinsky, on me. Gaston, we're going to Entre Deux and then to the base. You are free to follow or find your own way. Wait for our signal, we attack the base together.","",lemontov
STRM_36v103,"I like that plan. We'll be in touch.","",astier
STRM_36v104,"Spetsnaz, on comrade Lemontov!","",kaplinsky

STRM_36v105,"You again getting me out of prison, Gaston. For the second time now.","",poincare
STRM_36v106,"Don't get used to it, Jean. I'm getting old and I might not be there for you the third time!","",astier
STRM_36v107,"Thank you for having my back but did tou have to ask the Soviets for help?","",poincare
STRM_36v108,"It was either your life or my pride. It was not a hard desicion. And they delivered.","",astier
STRM_36v109,"I don't like it. We should get out of here.","",poincare
STRM_36v110,"American patrols! We need to move!","",someone - french accent
STRM_36v111,"American patrols! We need to move!","",someone - russian

STRM_36v112,"Back into the forest. Let's go.","", lemontov

STRM_36v113,"To the boats in the port. Quickly!","",lemontov

STRM_36v114,"You helped us out, Soviets. We expected much, much less from you. So thank you.","",astier
STRM_36v115,"Comrade major?","",lemontov
STRM_36v116,"This is nothing personal, Gaston. And I am truly sorry for what I'm about to do.","",lemontov
STRM_36v117,"Open fire!","",lemontov
STRM_36v118,"Good work, comrade major. Your loyalty will not go unnoticed.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v119,"We're done here. Let's go back!","",kaplinsky

STRM_36v120,"Into the boats, rebels, now!","",lemontov
STRM_36v121,"What's going on, Lemontov?","",astier
STRM_36v122,"You are to take your men and leave Everon for a month at the very least. Get onto one of the small islands around and stay there.","",lemontov
STRM_36v123,"What are you saying?","",astier
STRM_36v124,"My official orders are to execute you here and now. I am not going to do that.\nWe got rid of all the witnesses, so get on that boat if you wish to see the next sunrise!","",lemontov
STRM_36v125,"Let's go! Let's go!","",poincare
STRM_36v126,"You truly have grand character, Lemontov","",astier
STRM_36v127,"Go, Gaston! Before my own men show up.","",lemontov
STRM_36v128,"We owe you, Lemontov. Thank you. Good luck on your path!","",astier

STRM_36v129,"Comrade major! Over here!","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v130,"Why didn't you call us in?","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v131,"The reception kept getting cut off. I could not reach you. We fought our way to the base successfully though.","",lemontov
STRM_36v132,"We heard gunshots. Have you done the deed?","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v133,"Yes, they're dead.","",lemontov
STRM_36v134,"You killed them all on your own?","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v135,"It's easier when they turn their back to you. It also helped they trusted me, after I led them all morning.","",lemontov
STRM_36v136,"I must say that was ingenious! You truly are the greatest among Spetsnaz. I salute you, comrade!","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v137,"Your loyalty will not go unnoticed. Let's go back!","",kaplinsky
