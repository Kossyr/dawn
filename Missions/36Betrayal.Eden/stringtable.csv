STRM_ONLOAD_INTRO,"Montignac","",On load intro

STRM_36v01,"Enjoying the view?","",lemontov
STRM_36v02,"Very much actually. Montignac is a beautiful city after all - the island' capital and its prized jewel. And it only took us two days to capture it.","",zubarev
STRM_36v03,"Certainly better than the last time. ","",lemontov
STRM_36v04,"True. Let us not beat around the bush any longer. I don't wish to insult your intelligence, Lemontov.\nYou must have long figured out the first attack was just a small nudge, testing the waters, so to speak. To see if the NATO would take the bait.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v05,"I did suspect as much.","",lemontov
STRM_36v06,"Of course you did. It was blatantly obvious. Although it did get past all those idiots in Kremlin.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v07,"You speak very brazenly.","",lemontov
STRM_36v08,"We are far from the central government, Lemontov. We are more free than others. Free to pursue our own goals.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v09,"You might not be fully aware that after Livanokh the Kolguyev garrison was reduced to only a token force.\nThe peace treaty required it. It was done to make sure we never threaten local stability again.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v10,"What changed?","",lemontov
STRM_36v11,"The American intervention on Everon, of course. Their military buildup and expansion had to be answered - we received more men.\nNot enough to mount a serious attack, but enough to create new opportunities.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v12,"A good plan  - my own I might add. But even when the enemy marched on Kolguyev, the Kremlin lost balls.\nI had to make sure our situation weas truly hopeless for them to finally budge and grant us the resources we required.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v13,"The attack in central Kolguyev... You groveling before Volkov... all this time, your incompetence was just a play?","",lemontov
STRM_36v14,"I thought you would see through it. It brings me joy to know I managed to deceive the great Grigory Lemontov.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v15,"A great feat indeed. Tell me then, what do you need this army for?","",lemontov
STRM_36v16,"You are aware, of course, that Everon is not our final goal. This story does not end here. It is Malden and it has always been Malden.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v17,"But what is there I am not at liberty to disclose to you at this moment. But follow us and you shall find out for yourself eventually.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v18,"Now, I laid my cards on the table so that you are aware of the situation and who you are dealing with. Come in, we need to discuss the next phase.","",
STRM_36v19,"I'm going to go straigth to the point. The rebel commander, Gaston, came to us and requested our help. Apparently, a lot of their men were captured and taken prisoner - including their second in command, one Poincare.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v20,"We found where they are held. Your task is to join forces with the rebels and help them reclaim those prisoners.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v21,"Sounds easy enough.","",lemontov
STRM_36v22,"That's not all. Once you rescue them, kill them.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v23,"They are relentless, they fight for their beliefs no matter the opposition and they shall never stop. \nThey are a hindrance and dangerous one at that.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v24,"Either we deal with them now or they are going to cause us problems in the long run. Executing their highest command should do the trick.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v25,"So you wish to screw over them the second time? And again hiding behiind the mask of friendship while stabbing them in the back?","",lemontov
STRM_36v26,"You tried to deal with them in the past and look how that turned out. You failed to get rid of their leaders, that's where you erred.\nBut we've got both of them in once place this time.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v27,"And friends? Please. Temporary co-belligerents is more likely. They will turn on us the moment the NATO is gone. We shall just turn on them first.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v28,"It's one thing to defeat them in battle. It's another to slaughter them like animals when they can't even defend themselves.","",lemontov
STRM_36v29,"You are deceiving yourself if you think this is any more different than what you did seven years ago with Livanokh.\nI'm just asking you to finish the job you already started.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v30,"Look, Lemontov, this order came straight from comrade Volkov and it's not up for discussion. He wants you to do it personally.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v31,"What's the position of Kremlin on this?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v32,"I don't know, you would have to ask them.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v33,"I take it they did not sanction it then.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v34,"For fuck's sake, Lemontov, of course not! Kremlin has no power here! On this island, my word is as much worth as that of the General Secretary!\nHere, you only answer to me.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v35,"Still need convincing? You know, I am long looking for an excuse to put a bullet in your head. Will you give me one?","",Zubarev
STRM_36v36,"I'll do it, of course. My loyalty is yours, comrade Zubarev.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v37,"We shall see about that. A meeting with the rebels, tomorrow morning here. Don't be late. Dismissed!","",Zubarev

STRM_36v38,"Piece of shit... Volkov's yes man, my ass. I have to talk to Stas, things are moving quickly.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v39,"Grigory! Hey, Grigory!","",Rashiv
STRM_36v40,"Sergei! What happened to you to end up in the hospital?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v41,"Le Moule happened. Tough fight. We almost had to retreat but an ace pilot saved our asses. What about you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v42,"Me? Yeah, I'm alright. Listen, can we talk more privately? Let's go over there for a second.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v43,"I thought we should not talk discreetly in public.","",Rashiv
STRM_36v44,"Sergei, listen, something terrible is about to happen. The rebels need our help rescuing their comrades from prison.\nWe are to provide assistance tomorrow.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v45,"That's terrible how?","",rashiv
STRM_36v46,"We are to... execute them right after.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v47,"Wh...What?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v48,"Zubarer just told me. Apparently, a direct order from Volkov. They want to finish the Everon resistance for good.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v49,"Well, you're not going to do it, are you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v50,"What am I supposed to do, Sergei? It's a direct order. If I don't do it, they find someone else and I'm going to the tribunal.\nOr better yet, straight in front of the firing squad!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v51,"Grigory, you cannot do this!","",rashiv
STRM_36v52,"I must do it! Do you not see?!","",lemontov
STRM_36v53,"They are our allies! They've been fighting for their lifes, for their freedom for years - and you're going to slaughter them like animals? Cowardly stabbing them in the back?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v54,"What other choice do I have, Sergei?","",lemontov
STRM_36v55,"You can choose not to do it!","",rashiv
STRM_36v56,"Then it's my head on the chopping block! How does that solve anything!?","",lemontov
STRM_36v57,"This is certainly a war crime! Orders like this have to go through the Politburo.","",Rashiv
STRM_36v58,"Sergei, the government holds no power here. Volkov and Zubarev are calling all the shots.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v59,"What about making our move then? What about we march in and shoot down Zubarev, Volkov and all the others? Take matters into our own hands.","",rashiv
STRM_36v60,"That's folly, Sergei. Volkov isn't even here! The army will see us as mutineers and traitors. We would be lucky to even get close to Zubarev.\nNo, this is not yet the time to strike.","",lemontov
STRM_36v61,"It's always waiting with you, Grigory! We are still waiting, still biding our time, still expecting some new information to shed a light on the fact we are completele fucked. When is it going to be the time to act?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v62,"We would die pointless deaths if we are not ready. It will not be on Everon, Sergei.","",lemnontov
STRM_36v63,"So you're waiting for Malden then. Expecting the grand reveal of their goal to solve everything? And you're willing to let the rebels die for it?","",rashiv
STRM_36v64,"This is not what I would have wanted, but if that's what it takes - yes.","",lemontov
STRM_36v65,"I cannot believe this. I fought with them, Grigory. They saved my life!","",rashiv
STRM_36v66,"I am sorry, Sergei, but if they must be killed in order to save the world then we cannot hesitate!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v67,"I've never been this disappointed in anyone. I thought you were better, Grigory. If you must do it, so be it. But don't come anywhere near me ever again.","",rashiv
STRM_36v68,"Sergei! Sergei?!","",lemontov





STRM_36v69,"Your car is ready, comrade major.","",soldier

STRM_36v70,"I slept terribly.","",lemontov
STRM_36v71,"Did I even sleep? The whole night feels like a fever dream to me.","",lemontov
STRM_36v72,"What am I even doing? What am I going to do?","",lemontov
STRM_36v73,"Executing the rebels.. I feel sick. Sergei's pissed, understandably. What can we do against orders though? Zubarev was clear it's my head or theirs.","",lemontov
STRM_36v74,"He played me like a fiddle. Of course he is not a bumbling idiot, I am the idiot!","",lemontov
STRM_36v75,"I underestimated him badly. How could it happen? I normally see right through people. My perception is in the shitter.","",lemontov
STRM_36v76,"This must not happen again. Mistake like this can cost us everything!","",lemontov
STRM_36v77,"But of what this? One thing is to kill in war, another is to stab in the back. Like some underhanded rogue. The worst kind of a two-faced shakal.","",lemontov
STRM_36v78,"I feel worse than shit. And the day has barely started.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v79,"Is there a way to save them? Hardly, I'm going to be watched by my own team. Kaplinsky probably has strict orders - if I let them go, I'm going to get a bullet in the back of my head.","",lemontov
STRM_36v80,"This is so shit! I feel so powerless. A murder is about to happen and I am to be the main perpetrator. And I can't do anything about it.","",lemontov
STRM_36v81,"I must stop Volkov and Zubarev from reaching their goal on Malden. Do I have to become a war criminal to do that?\nThis is probably their game to test my loyalties.","",lemontov
STRM_36v82,"Fuck this shit. I am Grigory Lemontov, goddamit! I did not come this far to fail. Fuck you, Zubarev, two can play that game.","",lemontov

STRM_36v83,"Comrade major, we've been waiting for you. Our squad is ready. This is Gaston Astier and his people. They understand English.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v84,"You truly do give us the best. After your performance at our castle, I'm looking forward to working with you, Lemontov.","",astier
STRM_36v85,"Likewise. Let's get to it. What do we have?","",lemontov 
STRM_36v86,"A small mechanized squad is preparing to attack Entre Deux. We can go with them to get closer to our target.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v87,"The prisoners are kept at a coastal base in the east. There are two roads leading there.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v88,"We should avoid the southern front and large bases, otherwise it shouldn't be an issue. We are ready to go if you are.","",kaplinsky

STRM_36v89,"I'm taking the rebels with me. You join the attack on Entre Deux and then get ready to join us at the base. I'll give you the signal.","",lemontov
STRM_36v90,"I'm not sure, comrade major, I have my orders...","",Kaplinsky
STRM_36v91,"I have mine too. This is the best way to fulfill them.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v92,"I think I understand, comrade. Very well, we're going in on your signal.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v93,"What's the plan?","",astier
STRM_36v94,"You're going to follow me. First stop is Entre Deux, then your friends.","",lemontov
STRM_36v95,"Hold on, who says we want to follow your orders? My men will not like it.","",astier
STRM_36v96,"Listen here, Gaston, and listen well. You will follow and you will obey.\nYou are not on the best terms with our command.\nYou do what I say and we are all going to be happy at the end of this. Got it?","",lemontov
STRM_36v97,"Our position is indeed bad if we have to ask the Soviets for any help. But I do hold you in higher regard than most of your countrymen.\nVery well, we're going with you.","",astier
STRM_36v98,"We follow Lemontov!","",astier

STRM_36v99,"Let's get moving then. Kaplinsky, on me. Gaston, we're going to Entre Deux and then to the base. You are free to follow or find your own way. Wait for our signal, we attack the base together.","",lemontov
STRM_36v100,"I like that plan. We'll be in touch.","",astier
STRM_36v101,"Spetsnaz, on Lemontov!","",kaplinsky

STRM_36v102,"You again are getting me out of prison, Gaston. For the second time now.","",poincare
STRM_36v103,"Don't get used to it, Jean. I'm getting old and I might not be there for you the third time!","",astier
STRM_36v104,"You had to ask the Soviets for help?","",poincare
STRM_36v105,"It was either your life or my pride. It was not a hard desicion. And they delivered.","",astier
STRM_36v106,"I don't like it. We should get out of here.","",poincare
STRM_36v107,"American patrols! We need to move!","",someone
STRM_36v108,"Where to, Lemontov?","",astier

STRM_36v109,"Back into the forest. Let's go.","", lemontov

STRM_36v110,"To the boats in the port. Quickly!","",lemontov

STRM_36v111,"You helped us out, Soviets. We expected much, much less from you. So thank you.","",astier
STRM_36v112,"Comrade major?","",lemontov
STRM_36v113,"This is nothing personal, Gaston. And I am truly sorry for what I'm about to do.","",lemontov
STRM_36v114,"Open fire!","",lemontov

STRM_36v115,"Into the boats, rebels, now!","",lemontov
STRM_36v116,"What's going on, Lemontov?","",astier
STRM_36v117,"You are to take your men and leave Everon for a few weeks at least. Get onto one of the small islands around and stay there.","",lemontov
STRM_36v118,"What are you saying?","",astier
STRM_36v119,"My official orders are to execute you here and now. I am not going to do that. We got rid of all the witnesses, so get on that boat if you wish to see the next sunrise!","",lemontov
STRM_36v120,"Let's go! Let's go!","",poincare
STRM_36v121,"You truly have grand character, Lemontov","",astier
STRM_36v122,"Go, Gaston! Before my own men show up.","",lemontov
STRM_36v123,"We owe you, Lemontov. Thank you. Good luck on your path!","",astier

STRM_36v124,"Comrade major! Over here!","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v125,"We heard gunshots. Have you done the deed?","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v126,"Yes, they're dead.","",lemontov
STRM_36v127,"You killed them all on your own?","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v128,"It's easier when they turn their back to you. It also helped they trusted me, after I led them all morning.","",lemontov
STRM_36v129,"I must say that was ingenious. You truly are the greatest Spetsnaz.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v130,"Good work, comrade major. Your loyalty will not go unnoticed. Let's go back!","",kaplinsky
