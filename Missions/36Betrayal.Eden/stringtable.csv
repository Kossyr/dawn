STRM_36v01,"Enjoying the view?","",lemontov
STRM_36v02,"Very much actually. Montignac is a beautiful city after all - and now we are here to finally restore order.\nAnd it took us only two days since landing.","",zubarev
STRM_36v03,"Certainly better than the last time. ","",lemontov
STRM_36v04,"True. Let us not beat around the bush any longer. I don't wish to insult your intelligence, Lemontov.\nYou must have long figured out the first attack was just a small nudge, testing the waters, so to speak. To see if the NATO would take the bait.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v05,"I did suspect as much.","",lemontov
STRM_36v06,"Of course you did. I did not think for a second our plan would get past you. Although it did get past all those idiots in Kremlin.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v07,"You speak very openly.","",lemontov
STRM_36v08,"We are very far from the central government, Lemontov. We are more free than others. Free to pursue ou rown goals.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v09,"You might not be fully aware that after Livanokh the Kolguyev garrison was reduced to only a token force.\nThe peace treaty required it. It was done to make sure we never threaten local stability again.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v10,"What changed?","",lemontov
STRM_36v11,"The American intervention on Everon, of course. Their military buildup and expansion had to be answered - we received more men.\nNot enough to mount a serious attack, but enough to create new opportunities.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v12,"A good plan  - my own I might add. But even when the enemy marched on Kolguyev, the Kremlin lost balls.\nI had to make sure our situation weas truly hopeless for them to finally budge and grant us the resources we required.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v13,"The attack in central Kolguyev... all this time, your incompetence was just a play?","",lemontov
STRM_36v14,"I thought you would see through it. It brings me joy to know I managed to deceive the great Grigory Lemontov.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v15,"A great feat indeed. Tell me then what do you need this army for?","",lemontov
STRM_36v16,"You are aware, of course, that Everon is not our final goal. This story does not end here. It is Malden and it has always been Malden.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v17,"But what is there I am not at liberty to disclose to you at this moment. But follow us and you shall find out for yourself.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v18,"Now, I laid my cards on the table so that you are aware of the situation and who you are dealing with. Come in, we need to discuss the next phase.","",
STRM_36v19,"I'm going to go straigth to the point. The rebels came to us and requested our help. Apparently, a lot of their men were captured and taken prisoner - including their second in command.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v20,"We found where they are held. Your task is to join forces with the rebels and help them reclaim those prisoners.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v21,"Sounds easy enough.","",lemontov
STRM_36v22,"That's not all. Once you rescue them, kill them.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v23,"What?","",lemontov
STRM_36v24,"They are like rats. You get rid of them and they always come back. They are relentless, they fight for their beliefs no matter the opposition.\nThey are dangereous and must be dealt with. We are not making any mistakes this time.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v25,"Either we deal with them now or they are going to cause us problems in the long run. Executing their highest command should do the trick.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v26,"This is... this is low, Zubarev.","",lemontov
STRM_36v27,"Low? This is how you operate, Lemontov. What's the deal? This should be just another mission for you.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v28,"We made a deal with them. They are our allies. Betraying them like that...","",lemontov
STRM_36v29,"There is no betrayal, we never signed anything. And allies? Please. Temporary co-belligerent is more likely. They will turn on us the moment the NATO is gone.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v30,"Stil, I find it underhanded... unbecoming...","",lemontov
STRM_36v31,"Is this even Lemontov speaking? My, my, I knew the prison softened you.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v32,"I am far from soft, Zubarev. I find it deplorable, that's all. This is not the way things should be handled.","",lemontov
STRM_36v33,"You might find it surprising, but I do agree with you. This order is straight from comrade Volkov though and it's not up for discussion.","",Zubarev
STRM_36v34,"Are we clear on this, Lemontov? You know, I am long looking for an excuse to put a bullet in your head. Will you give me one?","",Zubarev
STRM_36v35,"Hm? Is dying as a traitor to your liking? What's it going to be?","",Zubarev
STRM_36v36,"I'll do it, of course. I am loyal, Zubarev, never doubt it.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v37,"I never did. I just wonder who to. A meeting with the rebels, tomorrow morning here. Don't be late. Dismissed!","",Zubarev 

STRM_36v38,"This is terrible... Absolutely terrible...","",Lemontov
STRM_36v39,"What am I supposed to do?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v40,"Grigory! Hey, Grigory!","",Rashiv
STRM_36v41,"Sergei! What happened to you to end up in the hospital?","",Lemontov
STRM_36v42,"Le Moule happened. Tough fight. We almost had to retreat but an ace pilot saved our asses. What about you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v43,"Me? Yeah, I'm alright. Listen, can we talk more privately? Let's go over there for a second.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v44,"Sure, lead the way.","",Rashiv
STRM_36v45,"I thought we should not talk discreetly in public.","",Rashiv
STRM_36v46,"Sergei, listen, something terrible is about to happen. The rebels need our help rescuing their comrades from prison.\nWe are to provide assistance tomorrow.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v47,"That's terrible how?","",rashiv
STRM_36v48,"We are to... execute them right after.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v49,"Wh...What?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v50,"I know, I know. Volkov's orders. Or maybe Zubarev's. I don't even know anymore. It's fucked up beyond belief.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v51,"Well, you're not going to do it, are you?","",Rashiv
STRM_36v52,"What am I supposed to do, Sergei? It's a direct order. If I don't do it, they find someone else and I'm going to the tribunal.\nOr better yet, straight in front of the firing squad!","",Lemontov
STRM_36v53,"Grigory, you cannot do this!","",rashiv
STRM_36v53,"I must do it! Do you not see?!","",lemontov
STRM_36v54,"They are our allies! They've been helping us, they are ready to put down their arms once we are done here! They desire peace! And you're going to slaughter them like animals? In the middle of a rescue operation at that?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v55,"What other choice do I have, Sergei?","",lemontov
STRM_36v56,"You can choose not to do it!","",rashiv
STRM_36v57,"Then it's my head on the chopping block! How does that solve anything!?","",lemontov
STRM_36v58,"What about making our move? What about we march in and shoot down Zubarev, Volkov and all the others? Take matters into our own hands.","",rashiv
STRM_36v59,"That's crazy, Sergei. Volkov isn't even here! The army will see us as mutineers and traitors. We would be lucky to even get close to Zubarev.\nNo, the time to strike is not yet here.","",lemontov 
STRM_36v60,"It's always waiting with you, Grigory! We are still waiting, still biding our time, still expecting some new information to shed a light on the fact we are completele fucked. When is it going to be the time to act?!","",rashiv
STRM_36v61,"We would die pointless deaths if we are not ready. It will not be on Everon, Sergei.","",lemnontov
STRM_36v62,"So you're waiting for Malden then. Expecting the grand reveal of their goal to solve everything? And you're willing to let the rebels die for it?","",rashiv
STRM_36v63,"This is not what I would have wanted, but if that's what it takes - yes.","",lemontov
STRM_36v64,"I cannot believe this. I fought with them, Grigory. They saved my life!","",rashiv
STRM_36v65,"I've never been this disappointed in anyone. I thought you were better, Grigory. If you must do it, so be it. But don't come anywhere near me ever again.","",rashiv
STRM_36v66,"Sergei! Sergei?!","",lemontov

STRM_36v67,"Your car is ready, comrade major.","",soldier

STRM_36v68,"I slept terribly.","",lemontov
STRM_36v69,"Did I even sleep? The whole night feels like a fever dream to me.","",lemontov
STRM_36v70,"What am I even doing? What am I going to do?","",lemontov
STRM_36v71,"Executing the rebels.. I feel sick. Sergei's pissed, understandably. What can we do against orders though?","",lemontov
STRM_36v72,"Is this truly Volkov's order? Or does it come from Zubarev?","",lemontov
STRM_36v73,"He played me like a fiddle. Of course he is not a bumbling idiot, I am the idiot!","",lemontov
STRM_36v74,"I underestimated him badly. How could it happen? I normally see right through people. My perception is in the shitter.","",lemontov
STRM_36v75,"This must not happen again. I must keep both my eyes open!","",lemontov
STRM_36v76,"But of what this? One thing is to kill in war, another is to stab in the back. Like some underhanded rogue. The worst kind of a two-faced shakal.","",lemontov
STRM_36v77,"I feel worse than shit. And the day has barely started.","",Lemontov
STRM_36v78,"Is there a way to save them? Hardly, I'm going to be watched by my own team. Probably Kaplinsky has strict orders - if I let them go, I'm going to get a bullet in the back of my head.","",lemontov
STRM_36v79,"This is so shit! I feel so powerless. A murder of a war crime level is about to happen and I am to be the main perpetrator. And I can't do anything about it.","",lemontov
STRM_36v80,"I must stop Volkov and Zubarev from reaching their goal on Malden. Do I have to become war criminal to do that?\nThis is probably their game to test my loyalties.","",lemontov
STRM_36v81,"Fuck this shit. I am Grigory Lemontov, after all. I did not come this far to fail. Fuck you, Zubarev, two can play that game.","",lemontov

STRM_36v82,"Comrade major, we've been waiting for you. Our squad is ready. This is Gaston AStier and his people. They understand English.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v83,"They also understand French, Kaplinsky.","",lemontov
STRM_36v84,"Hm, should not have been expecting anything less from the famous Lemontov. After that castle, I'm looking forward to working with you.","",astier
STRM_36v85,"Likewise. Let's get to it. What do we have?","",lemontov
STRM_36v86,"A small mechanized squad is preparing to attack Entre Deux. We can go with them to get closer to our target.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v87,"The prisoners are kept at a coastal base in the east. There are two roads leading there.","",kaplinsky
STRM_36v88,"We should avoid the southern front and large bases, otherwise it shouldn't be an issue. We are ready to go if you are.","",kaplinsky
