<b>29th January 1989</b> - The die has been cast. Volkov said that in a tent back on Kolguyev before he sent me with Rashiv to negotiate with the rebels. Zubarev said that today when referring to his grand plan - and before ordering me to kill the same rebels.
<br><br>
I was blind. I did not consider Zubarev to be anything more than insect. I usually don't underestimate my opponents, but he played it well. Volkov's right hand is a man to be feared after all.
<br><br>
He told me to my face that he was a traitor no longer receiving orders from the central government and I couldn't do anything about it. In fact, I have to do his bidding now if I want to live, as if my life wasn't hanging by a thread already.
<br><br>
I should have done something back in Russia. That was my only chance to get out of their grasp. Ever since my return, they've been spying on me. The fact they knew about Rashiv's involvement with the rebels is a dead giveaway.
<br><br>
Kaplinsky spends a lot of time around me. I would not put it behind him to rummage through my tent every night looking for notes. Although, it might even be for the better since now they think I promoted Sergey for his Everon adventure - they can't possibly know the real reason, can they? No. They can't know about Vadim, otherwise Sergey would not have been assigned to Kolguyev. His presence at least proves they still don't know everything.
<br><br>
What they do know is the strategic value of Everon and they are willing to wrestle its control for the final time - by getting rid of all the opposition. I must say, I did not expect Volkov to get this low - making me and Sergey get the rebels' help only to kill them off in the most backstabbing way possible. It is a despicable act of the greatest villainy, that is for sure. A murder on a level of a war crime is about to happen and I am to be the main perpetrator.
<br><br>
Sergey made his position clear. He is right, of course, although he sees it in too simple light. It's not a question of doing what is right, but what is necessary. I cannot let the traitors plunge the world into a devastating war. I cannot let them finish what Livanokh started. I simply cannot!
<br><br>
The final confrontation draws near. But we are not ready. We cannot fight now, on their terms. I have to go along, finish the mission the way they want, get closer to them, follow the plan. Too much is at stake, too much to lose. I must not falter for I am the only one capable of stopping the coming storm. It is my duty to see this through to the bitter end.
<br><br>
Screw Volkov and screw Zubarev. If they don't think I am able to do this horrendous deed to reach my goal, they are mistaken.
<br><br>
I am willing to go far to stop them.

Everon will soon be ours, comrade major Lemontov. We shall strike south and defeat the last remnants of the enemy forces, but before that, it is high time we deal with the local resistance. They helped us during the island's reconquest, but their usefulness is at an end. If we are to deal with them, it is of upmost importance to do it now before they have a chance to regroup and cause us more trouble in the future.
<br><br>
Recently, one of their leaders was captured. He and others are held at the <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> on the eastern coast. You are to join forces with the rebels and rescue those prisoners. Once they are secured, execute them. Be sure to confirm the kills of their two commanders - Gaston Astier and Jean Poincare.
<br><br>
You start the mission outside your tent in <a href="marker:Start">Meaux</a>.

<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Get in your car and head south. The spetsnaz group Roman under Kaplinsky and resistance squad Sparrow under Astier are waiting for you at a meeting point in <a href="marker:Meeting">Montignac</a>. Get there and take command.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Sneak or fight your way through the enemy territory towards the coastal <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> where the captive rebels are being held. Watch out for enemy encampments dotted around the area. Many enemy forces retreated here after the capture of Montignac. All known camps are marked on your map.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Group Ivan is getting ready to attack <a href="marker:EntreDeux">Entre Deux</a>. You can join them in their assault or find you own way. They will attack regardless of your presence.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Seize the coastal <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> and rescue the prisoners.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Execute all the rebels including their commanders - Gaston Astier and Jean Poincare.</p>

<br>
<p>You have done well, comrade Lemontov. With the resistance finally crushed, nothing stands in our way to secure the island once and for all. You have proved your loyalties today and that you stand on the right side. Comrade Volkov will want a word with you, once he arrives. Good work, comrade Lemontov.</p>

<p>You have done well, comrade Lemontov. Although we weren't sure about the success of the mission for a time there, you got through and won us the day. With the resistance finally crushed, nothing stands in our way to secure the island once and for all. You have proved your loyalties today and that you stand on the right side. Comrade Volkov will want a word with you, once he arrives. Good work, comrade Lemontov.</p>
