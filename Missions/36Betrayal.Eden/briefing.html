    <b>29th January 1988</b> - Hero of the Soviet Union, they called me. I was respected by my peers. I was loved by the people. I was feared by my enemies. Me and Livanokh, the future of our country. And then it all disappeared.
    <br><br>
    One of the great heroes is dead and the other is about to become a war criminal. How did it go so wrong? Ever since I returned, I don't feel like I'm in control. I was not allowed out of the army even for a second. I was not allowed to go anywhere without Kaplinsky or some other Spetsnaz breathing on my back. From prison to Kolguyev, straight to Leningrad, Afghanistan, back to Kolguyev and now Everon. I never had any say in it. Volkov was manipulating me from the start to do his bidding. And I, in fear of them discovering my secret, obeyed.
    <br><br>
    I should have done something back in Russia. I should not have been so blind. The writing was on the wall the whole time. Now it's all slowly coming to light.
    <br><br>
    I knew the attack on Everon was fake. It was supposed to entice Americans to come for us on Kolguyev - which they did, the fools. Is George leading them? What the heck was he thinking? Not to mention the stupid idea to seize Everon again. That was the catalyst for all this. Now that Volkov leads a sizable Soviet army, he is not going to stop before he takes Malden. And we are far away from Moscow for them to have any say in this. 
    <br><rr>
    It's been ages since I heard any news. Is something going on out there? I feel like in a bubble, which to be honest, is what most of my missions behind enemy lines feel like, but this is getting suspicious. I'm starting to doubt that even this reclamation of Everon was sanctioned by Kremlin.
    <br><br>
    There might be something going on out there that we don't know about. We're blind like rats.
    <br><br>
    My advesaries are getting bold. Zubarev told me to my face that he was a traitor no longer receiving orders from Kremlin and I could not do anything about it. In fact, I have to do his bidding now if I want to live. As if my life wasn't hanging by a thread already.
    <br><br>
    And then there is this rebel business. I did not expect Volkov to get this low - making me and Sergei get the rebels' help only to get rid of them unceremoniously later. It is a despicable act of the highest villainy, that is for sure. A murder on a level of a war crime is about to happen and I am to be the main perpetrator. 
    <br><br>
    What should I do? What am I going to do? Zubarev was clear: it's my head or theirs.
    <br><br>
    The stage is set. I am either going to go to sleep tonight a revolting murderer or a stinking corpse. With the fate of the world on the line, do I even have a choice?

    Everon will soon be ours, comrade major Lemontov. We shall strike south and defeat the last remnants of the enemy forces, but before that, it is prudent we deal with the local resistance. They helped us during the island's reconquest, but their usefulness is soon to run out. It is of upmost importance to deal with them now before they have a chance to regroup and cause us more trouble in the future.
    <br><br>
    Recently, one of their leaders was captured. He and others are held at the <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> on the eastern coast. You are to join forces with the rebels and rescue those prisoners. Once they are secured, execute them. Be sure to confirm the kills of their two commanders - Gaston Astier and Jean Poincare.
    <br><br>
    You start the mission outside your tent in <a href="marker:Start">Meaux</a>.

   <p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Sneak or fight your way through the enemy territory towards the coastal <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> where the captive rebels are being held. Watch out for enemy encampments dotted around the area. Many enemy forces retreated here after the capture of Montignac. All known camps are marked on your map.</p>

    <p>You have done well, comrade Lemontov. With the resistance finally crushed, nothing stands in our way to secure the island once and for all. You have proved your loyalties today and that you stand on the right side. Comrade Volkov will want a word with you, once he arrives. Good work, comrade Lemontov.</p>

    <p>You have done well, comrade Lemontov. Although we weren't sure about the usccess of the mission for a time there, you got through and won us the day.
