    <b>29th January 1988</b> - Hero of the Soviet Union, they called me. I was respected by my peers. I was loved by the people. I was feared by my enemies. Me and Livanokh, the future of our country. And then it all disappeared.
    <br><br>
    One of the great heroes is dead and the other is about to become a war criminal. How did it go so wrong? Ever since I returned, I don't feel like I'm in control. I was not allowed out of the army even for a second. I was not allowed to go anywhere without Kaplinsky or some other Spetsnaz breathing on my back. From prison to Kolguyev, straight to Leningrad, Afghanistan, back to Kolguyev and now Everon. I never had any say in it. Volkov was manipulating me from the start to do his bidding. And I, in fear of them discovering my secret, obeyed.
    <br><br>
    I should have done something back in Russia. I should not have been so blind. The writing was on the wall the whole time. Now it's all slowly coming to light.
    <br><br>
    I knew the attack on Everon was fake. It was supposed to entice Americans to come for us on Kolguyev - which they did, the fools. Is George leading them? What the heck was he thinking? Not to mention the stupid idea to seize Everon again. That was the catalyst for all this. Now that Volkov leads a sizable Soviet army, he is not going to stop before he takes Malden. And we are far away from Moscow for them to have any say in this. It's been ages since I heard any news. Is something going on out there? I feel like in a bubble, which to be honest, is what most of my missions behind enemy lines feel like, but this is getting suspicious. I'm starting to doubt that even this reclamation of Everon was canctioned by Kremlin.
    <br><br>
    They are becoming bold, Zubarev told me as much when I brought up the central government. He told me to my face that he was a traitor working to undermine Kremlin and I could not do anything about it. In fact, I have to do his bidding now if I want to live. As if my life wasn't hanging by a thread already. 
    <br><br>
    Volkov went rogue and the army with him, most of it probably unknowingly. We are retaking Everon to set up for our attack on Malden to obtain a secret weapon of unknown power. Who knows what is happening outside the islands, maybe a world war already started, I would not be surprised. I must continue serving to get closer to them so that when the time comes, I am in position to stop them. And that means doing the dishonorable and revolting act of executing all the rebels. Sergei is against the very idea and I am too. But I have to do it to stop Volkov. I have no other choice.
    <br><br>
    I should stop thinking about this for now, get some sleep and think this through with a clear head in the morning. Hopefully, the day will bring some answers.

    Everon will soon be ours, comrade major Lemontov. We shall strike south and defeat the last remnants of the enemy forces, but before that, it is prudent we deal with the local resistance. They helped us during the island's reconquest, but their usefulness is soon to run out. It is of upmost importance to deal with them now before they have a chance to regroup and cause us more trouble in the future.
    <br><br>
    Recently, one of their leaders was captured. He and others are held at the <a href="marker:Prisoners">base</a> on the eastern coast. You are to join forces with the rebels and rescue those prisoners. Once they are secured, execute them. Be sure to confirm the kills of their two commanders - Gaston Astier and Jean Poincare.
