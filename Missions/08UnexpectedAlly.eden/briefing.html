   <b>7.11.1986</b> - It's been a long day. And is still fram from over.
   <br><br>
   All the guys are dead. Dostoevsky, Morokov... Lying on that damn road or by some tree... Ivan even died right in front of me. And I couldn't have done anything to stop it. 
<br><br>
	The rebels helped me from captivity but they are far from friendly. More of a "situational ally".I hope they help me get to evacuation point at least. Though I imagined them differently. Didn't the officers say they requested our help? Pleaded for it even? Whoever those guys were these are not them. Also they speak French, I heard them talking while they were taking me to their leader. I did think Everon names sounded French for a reason...

	The convoy was ambushed. I got out of there with Ivan, but enemy captured us and executed him. A was about to share his fate when these guerilla fighters stepped in and helped me. Hopefully the'll get me off this island.

I am at <a href="marker:start">a small farm</a> with the rebels.

	<p>I got to the chopper in time and left the island. The rebel leader left me with interesting words that make me doubt my own command. What is going on here? And how the hell are we gonna repel NATO if they come for us on Kolguyev?</p>
