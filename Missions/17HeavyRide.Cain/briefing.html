<b>5th December 1988</b> - Day two of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
My first combat experience and I think I did very well. It is a lot different from training - bad decisions can be fatal here. I am not afraid though - I feel like I am finally where I belong and that makes me confident and resolute. I am not alone in the tank and I am not alone on the battlefield - tank corps is truly a family and I am blessed to be part of the best.
<br><br>
We stabilized the front and are now preparing to strike back. A high ranking officer arrived yesterday to brief comrade Frolov on the plan - I think it was even comrade Zubarev, the commander of our forces. It seems our platoon will be vital in taking back lost territory!

Today we are planning on launching a major offensive to advance the front further west. A combined assault of tanks and infantry will secure two bases and a significant amount of territory of central and southern Kolguyev.
<br><br>
Forward to victory, comrade!
<br><br>
You start with your platoon Yury at the <a href="marker:start">Astrabirsk</a> front lines.

<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Once the base is secure, head again southwards towards another <a href="marker:Crossroads2">crossroads</a>. Secure the area and leave platoon Tatyana here. They will cover your flanks.</p>

<br>
<p>The offensive was a partial success, but the main target is still held by the enemy. Our position is not favourable and we'll probably have to retreat further north.</p>
