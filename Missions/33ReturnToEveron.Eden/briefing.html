<b>26th January 1989</b> - The meeting with rebels went easier than expected. They are not as strong as I remember them and Gaston made it clear they are barely holding on. We might be their last chance to survive.
<br><br>
They had to retreat from the castle, and from Grigory's reports they lost a lot of men, but at least they're still alive. And now we are here to help them out. The rebels will finally have their island back. I can't wait to tell them their fight is at an end and they are to live in peace from now on. It is the least these people deserve after all they've been through, all their hardships.
<br><br>
Gaston shall return to his rightful place as their legitimate leader. Jean can finally find peace and maybe even forgive those who wronged him. Pierre died before our return. But his death as well as all the others was not in vain. Their fight was hard and bloody, but the end goal is within their grasp. 
<br><br>
This time we will kick the Americans out of the island for good. We shall kick them out of Malden as well if necessary. Giving these people their freedom, granting them their greatest wish they fought and bled for for so long, that is what makes this whole ordeal worth it.
<br><br>
Let Grigory and Stas worry about Zubarev's and Volkov's games. That's not what I'm currently fighting for. No politics, no intrigue. I just want the people of Everon to finally achieve peace.
