<b>26th January 1988</b> - The meeting with rebels went easier than expected. They are not as strong as I remember them and Gaston made it clear they are barely holding on. We might be their last chance to survive.
<br><br>
They had to retreat from the castle, and from Grigory's reports they lost a lot of men, but at least they're still alive. And now we are here to help them out. The rebels will finally have their island back. I can't wait to tell them their fight is at an end and they are to live in peace from now on. It is the least these people deserve after all they've been through, all their hardships.
<br><br>
Gaston shall return to his rightful place as their legitimate leader. Jean can finally find peace and maybe even forgive those who wronged him. Pierre died before our return. But his death as well as all the others was not in vain. Their fight was hard and bloody, but the end goal is within their grasp. 
<br><br>
This time we will kick the Americans out of the island for good. We shall kick them out of Malden as well if necessary. Giving these people their freedom, granting them their greatest wish they fought and bled for for so long, that is what makes this whole ordeal worth it.
<br><br>
Let Grigory and Stas worry about Zubarev's and Volkov's games. That's not what I'm currently fighting for. No politics, no intrigue. I just want the people of Everon to finally achieve peace.

<h2><a name="Invasion">Invasion plans</a></h2>
<p>
Invasion targets: <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>, <a href="marker:Base">eastern base</a>, <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>.
<br>
Invasion commander: comrade Lieutenant Sergey Rashiv, Leonid
<br>
Invasion groups: <a href="marker:Anton">Anton</a>, <a href="marker:Boris">Boris</a>, <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a>, <a href="marker:Fyodor">Fyodor</a>, <a href="marker:Konstantin">Konstantin</a>, <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a>, <a href="marker:Roman">Roman</a>, <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> and <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a>
<br><br>
<b>Saint Phillippe</b>
<br>
Infantry squads supported by BMPs are going to land on the beaches by the city of <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>. <a href="marker:Boris">Boris</a> shall attack from the road, <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a> from the forest, <a href="marker:Roman">Roman</a> and <a href="marker:Konstantin">Konstantin</a> from the beach and <a href="marker:Anton">Anton</a> from the northern road. Attack and seize the city. Intel suggests mainly infantry and few light tanks, nothing more serious than that. Expect enemy reinforcements to come from the direction of <a href="marker:Airport">the airport</a>, <a href="marker:Base">the eastern base</a> and also from the south. The enemy is sure to try and push us back from the city, the majority of the attacking squads should remain in Saint Phillippe to repel all counterattacks. Leonid shall continue east.
<br><br>
<b>Eastern base</b>
<br>
Squads <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a> and <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a> shall attack and seize small enemy <a href="marker:Base">base</a>. Only infantry should be present. There are only few places to enter the base due to the fence around the base and they are guarded, so be on your guard. Advance slowly, as enemy reinforcements might by this time be attacking from multiple directions to try and retake <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>. Ivan is infantry only squad and there is no tank support available for this part of the mission. 
<br><br>
<b>Airport</b>
<br>
The last and most important target. After seizing both <a rhef="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a> and <a href="marker:Base">the eastern base</a>, Leonid is to go north and together with other groups attack and seize the strategically important <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>. We expect a lot of infantry and tanks to be defending the area. Tread carefully. Our biggest advantage is the group <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a>, which shall provide you with air support and should be able to take care of any enemy tanks. While moving north, it is prudent to go along the coast rather than the main road, which is sure to be utilised by the enemy for counterattacks south. Leonid shall be the one to give the signal to start the attack, other groups are to make beachheads and wait for this signal to advance further. Both <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a> and <a href="marker:Fyodor">Fyodor</a> are infantry only squads. <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> consists of two Mi-24s.

</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>After landing, attack and seize <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>.</p>
<hr> 
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Move southeast and seize the <a href="marker:Base">eastern base</a>. Squad <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a> will support you from the south.</p>
<hr> 
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>After clearing out the <a href="marker:Base">base</a>, confiscate enemy vehicle or continue on foot north - towards the <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>. We recommend going along the coast to avoid enemy troops that might be present on the main road.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Seize the <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Destroy the anti-air gun at the <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a> so that helicopters from group <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> can support your attack.</p>

<p>The invasion was successful and we now hold the northernmost part of the island including the airport. Our strike south shall be swift and hard. Victory is near, comrade!</p>
