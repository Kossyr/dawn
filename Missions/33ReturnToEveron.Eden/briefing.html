<b>26th January 1988</b> - The meeting with rebels went easier than expected. They are not as strong as I remember them and Gaston made it clear they are barely holding on. We might be their last chance to survive.
<br><br>
They had to retreat from the castle, and from Lemontov's reports they lost a lot of men, but at least they're still alive. And now we are here to help them out.
<br><br>
The <a href="#Invasion">invasion plan</a> is quite straightforward. The main target is the <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>. Spetsnaz were supposed to strike at some hidden air base during the night. Combining that with the seizure of airport and we should gain air superiority. The next target is going to be Montignac. The command wants this reclamation of Everon to be done as soon as possible. After Montignac, it's a cleanup work.

<h2><a name="Invasion">Invasion plans</a></h2>
<p>
Invasion targets: <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>, <a href="marker:Base">eastern base</a>, <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>.
<br>
Invasion commander: comrade Lieutenant Sergei Rashiv, Leonid
<br>
Invasion groups: <a href="marker:Anton">Anton</a>, <a href="marker:Boris">Boris</a>, <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a>, <a href="marker:Fyodor">Fyodor</a>, <a href="marker:Konstantin">Konstantin</a>, <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a>, <a href="marker:Roman">Roman</a>, <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> and <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a>
<br><br>
<b>Saint Phillippe</b>
<br>
Infantry squads supported by BMPs are going to land on the beaches by the city of <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>. <a href="marker:Boris">Boris</a> shall attack from the road, <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a> from the forest, <a href="marker:Roman">Roman</a> and <a href="marker:Konstantin">Konstantin</a> from the beach and <a href="marker:Anton">Anton</a> from the northern road. Attack and seize the city. Intel suggests mainly infantry and few light tanks, nothing more serious than that. Expect enemy reinforcements to come from the direction of <a href="marker:Airport">the airport</a>, <a href="marker:Base">the eastern base</a> and also from the south. The enemy is sure to try and push us back from the city, the majority of the attacking squads should remain in Saint Phillippe to repel all counterattacks. Leonid shall continue east.
<br><br>
<b>Eastern base</b>
<br>
Squads <a href="marker:Start">Leonid</a> and <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a> shall attack and seize small enemy <a href="marker:Base">base</a>. Only infantry should be present. There are only few places to enter the base due to the fence around the base and they are guarded, so be on your guard. Advance slowly, as enemy reinforcements might by this time be attacking from multiple directions to try and retake <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a>. Ivan is infantry only squad and there is no tank support available for this part of the mission. 
<br><br>
<b>Airport</b>
<br>
The last and most important target. After seizing both <a rhef="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a> and <a href="marker:Base">the eastern base</a>, Leonid is to go north and together with other groups attack and seize the strategically important <a href="marker:Airport">airport</a>. We expect a lot of infantry and tanks to be defending the area. Tread carefully. Our biggest advantage is the group <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a>, which shall provide you with air support and should be able to take care of any enemy tanks. While moving north, it is prudent to go along the coast rather than the main road, which is sure to be utilised by the enemy for counterattacks south. Leonid shall be the one to give the signal to start the attack, other groups are to make beachhards and wait for this signal to advance further. Both <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a> and <a href="marker:Fyodor">Fyodor</a> are infantry only squads. <a href="marker:Ulyana">Ulyana</a> consists of two Mi-24s.
