<b>9th November 1988</b> - I single-handedly protected the wounded at a farm near Le Moule and I think I impressed the rebels. Enough to at least get me an audience with their leader. He's at some old <a href="marker:Castle">castle ruin</a> in the south.
<br><br>
We are still far from friends or allies but I think there is a mutual respect between us now. At least they no longer seem interested in stripping me of my gear and leaving me for the enemy.
<br><br>
The commander seems like a big deal - if I can convince him to help, I can surely get out of here back to Kolguyev. Then this nightmare will be finally over.

We're going south to rejoin our commander, Gaston. At the moment, he's at our southern base at the <a href="marker:Castle">castle</a>. 
<br><br>
We boarded a truck that will get us to the <a href="marker:Unload">valley</a> north-west of the castle. The rest of the way is mountainous but under our control so we should not have much trouble reaching our destination.
<br><br>
We start <a href="marker:Start">on the road</a> south.

<p>It was a perilous journey, but we got to the castle in one piece. State your plight to Gaston and try to get his support to leave the island.</p>
