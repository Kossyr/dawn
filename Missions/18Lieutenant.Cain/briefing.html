   <b>9.12.1986</b> - I knew Grigory Lemontov was an interesting man the moment I met him. Maybe even the moment I heard of him. Legendary Spetsnaz, went through hell and back again, hero of the Soviet Union and respected by his enemies. A friend to my father. And now a friend to me?
   <br><br>
   He promoted me to lieutenant and gave me my own squad. Stas was helping me the last two days to get a gist of things. Grigory is very busy in the command centre. He's devising strategy to win this war. The enemy is not making it easy, still outnumbering us and continuing to attack our positions. At least there are reinforcements coming in the next few days.
   <br><br>
   I always wanted to be like my father before he was killed. Afterwards I kind of fell into a state of not caring. I silently followed orders and tried to be as inconspicuous as possible. But Grigory needed someone for reserve at Lamentin. Grigory needed me. And I slowly began feeling like living again. He brought me back from my darkest places and now he hauled me even further.
	<br><br>
	I still haven't forgotten that the Everon's war was almost certainly fabricated. And Grigory seems to have his own ideas and doubts. He and Stas promised me a talk later. 
	<br><br>
	This is some serious intrigue I'm about to get into but it is the journey I embarked on. I was there in the first assault on Everon. I was there when Lamentin fell to Spetsnaz. I was there during the retreat. I was there with French guerillas and I talked and fought with them. 
	<br><br>
	If I believed in fate, I'd say that's fate.
