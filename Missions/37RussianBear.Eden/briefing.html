<b>1st February 1989</b> - Day forty-five of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
We took most of the island already. Only the southern part remains in the hands of the enemy. And I'm about to change that as well.
<br><br>
Since I've been promoted, I've led our tank forces to victory, one after another. We blitzed from the Everon airport to the capital city and took it in two hours. We smashed everything that was put in our way, an unstoppable wave of Soviet engineering, steel and comradeship. I am extremely proud that I was able to achive so much in such little time. Nobody should remember comrade Frolov by now, I proved myself more capable and far outperformed him. Comrade Kukushkin is the new tank force commander, bringing fame and glory to the corps!
<br><br>
Comrade Zubarev wishes to speak with me after this mission. I can't wait. We spoke many times during the last few days, but this time I feel will be different. He might finally put down the veil and invite me into the group that truly holds the power in the army. They see my potential, they see my loyalty, and they see my feats.
<br><br>
I earned my place and I deserve to be rewarded. I'll finally shackle the chains of my useless family of nobodies and become powerful, influential and great all by myself. Do you see me, father? I became ten times the man you ever were. You shall rot for all eternity in that shallow grave I dug for you, while I finally achieve what you never could.
<br><br>
Dmitry Kukushkin is a name everyone will know and respect! My finest hour is about to begin!

With the central Everon firmly in our hands, it is time to strike south and finish the reclamation of the island. It is up to the tank corps, comrade Kukushkin, to break the enemy resistance guarding the road south.
<br><br>
You have a T80 platoon Yury under your direct command while platoon Fyodor is going to follow in your steps a small distance back. Your first target is the village of <a href="marker:Morton">Morton</a>. Only a token enemy force should be holding it and should pose no problem for your eight tanks.
<br><br>
The goal of the mission is to reach <a href="marker:Levie">Levie</a>. A number of enemy tanks were spotted in the <a href="marker:Enemy">valley</a> by the coast. It seems the enemy expects us to advance this way as they mined the <a href="marker:Minefield">northern road</a>. Meet the enemy tanks head on and destroy them in open battle, showing them the might of the Soviet army!
<br><br>
You start with your two tank platoons <a href="marker:Start">near Morton</a>.
