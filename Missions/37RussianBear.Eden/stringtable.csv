STRM_37v17,"We've been writing to each other almost daily. But a few weeks back she suddenly stopped. I have not received a reply since.",Ablomov
STRM_37v18,"That is strange, but it could be due to number of reasons...",Rashiv
STRM_37v19,"Yes, I know it is easily explainable given the situation and the place, but it still makes me uneasy that something could be going on.",Ablomov
STRM_37v20,"I am sure everything is all right, Nikolay, and you'll soon hear that from Ekaterina as well.",Rashiv

STRM_37v28,"I think even four of us.",Ablomov

STRM_37v30,"How could you, Grigory? And why did I simply walk away instead of trying to help?\nI could have done something, I should have done something...",Rashiv
STRM_37v31,"You look troubled. Something on your mind?",Ablomov

STRM_37v43,"I would love to have you in the family as well!",Ablomov
STRM_37v44,"I don't really care about this stuff at the moment.",Rashiv
