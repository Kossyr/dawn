COMMENT,"------------------- Intro-------------------",

STRM_f02v01,"They told me I would find you here. What are you thinking about, Vladimir?",Zubarev
STRM_f02v02,"I stand at the very spot where comrade Livanokh planned the fall of the west.",Volkov
STRM_f02v03,"This is where he devised his plan. Years of planning, careful considerations, preparations and hope.",Volkov
STRM_f02v04,"He dreamed of putting down the capitalist sham and bring all the guilty to justice. A dream he never lived to see.",Volkov
STRM_f02v05,"If only these walls could talk. If only we could glance at the events of the past...",Volkov
STRM_f02v06,"... and find comrade Livanokh at his desk, preparing...",Volkov
STRM_f02v07,"... at this balcony, considering his next steps...",Volkov
STRM_f02v08,"... his final moments in this villa, dying from a wound inflicted by an American bullet.",Volkov
STRM_f02v09,"If only, Zinovy. It is up to us to finish what he started. Do you bring news?",Volkov
STRM_f02v10,"Yes, I do.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v11,"Then let us talk.",Volkov

STRM_f02v12,"I had another disagreement with Frolov. He does not believe we are on the right path anymore.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v13,"What changed?",Volkov
STRM_f02v14,"His wife died two years ago and he has not been himself ever since.\nHe believes God punished him for his past and took her away.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v15,"He regrets taking part in the first war.\nI can't be certain of him anymore.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v16,"Then we should be ready to find a suitable alternative. Look around for some loyal and ambitious recruits.\nFrolov still prefers to command from the front, doesn't he?",Volkov
STRM_f02v17,"Indeed.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v18,"If it comes down to it, we could arrange an accident. Nothing can come between us and Malden.",Volkov
STRM_f02v19,"Of course. On another note, the people from Europe perform really well, actually.\nChernikov does what he's told without question, Kaplinsky has a sharp mind and is loyal to me personally...",Zubarev
STRM_f02v20,"That infamous tale of the convoy ambush in Afghanistan. I heard that one too many times.",Volkov
STRM_f02v21,"They were about to drown him in those marshes if I hadn't arrived. I love the story myself.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v22,"Back to the topic at hand, Syomin is the newest. I am not yet completely sure, but given what we know...",Zubarev
STRM_f02v23,"Observe him, but he shouldn't be an issue. Good, Zinovy, we are almost ready.",Volkov
STRM_f02v24,"You keep saying that. For years now, actually.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v25,"Patience is a virtue. This time, I truly mean it. There is one remaining topic - Lemontov.",Volkov
STRM_f02v26,"Is he not in prison?",Zubarev
STRM_f02v27,"A possibility presented itself to get him out.",Volkov
STRM_f02v28,"What? How?",Zubarev
STRM_f02v29,"Do you remember those spies captured last year?\nThey were not able to get anything useful out of them, but the US is keen on getting them back.",Volkov
STRM_f02v30,"They are willing to exchange prisoners - Lemontov for their return.",Volkov
STRM_f02v31,"Are you serious? Do you agree?",Zubarev
STRM_f02v32,"I can't afford not to agree. Comrade Livanokh's right hand man and a military genius -\n- without him we have a chance to win, with him I am certain of victory.",Volkov
STRM_f02v33,"Do you not believe me to pull my weight?",Zubarev
STRM_f02v34,"Of course I do, Zinovy, but this is Lemontov we speak of.\nForget your pride for once for the good of the plan.",Volkov
STRM_f02v35,"It seems I am to be replaced and I don't like it.",Zubarev
STRM_f02v36,"Don't be foolish. I don't trust Lemontov as far as I can throw him. I'm not about to hand him over the command of our forces.",Volkov
STRM_f02v37,"No, rather we use his abilities to our advantage and probe him to find out what he knows. Confirm our theories.",Volkov
STRM_f02v38,"That I can agree with, Vladimir. Although I still maintain we do not need him. We'll get him anyway once...",Zubarev
STRM_f02v39,"I already made the choice, the exchange could happen in a few months time.\nI will return on that day to meet him personally.",Volkov
STRM_f02v40,"In the meantime, follow the plan. We are on our way to change the world forever.",Volkov
