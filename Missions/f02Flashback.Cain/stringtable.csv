STRM_f02v01,"They told me I would find you here. What are you thinking about, Vladimir?","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v02,"I stand at the very spot where comrade Livanokh planned the fall of the west.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v03,"This is where he devised his plan. Years of planning, careful considerations, preparations and hope.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v04,"His dream od putting down the capitalist sham and bring all the guilty to justice. Dream he never lived to see.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v05,"These walls could tell stories. If only I could see through them...","",Volkov
STRM_f02v06,"... and find comrade Livanokh at his desk, preparing...","",Volkov
STRM_f02v07,"... at this balcony, considering his next steps...","",Volkov
STRM_f02v08,"... his final moments in this villa, dying from a wound inflicted by an American bullet.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v09,"If only, Zinovy. It is up to us to finish what he started. Do you bring news?","",Volkov
STRM_f02v10,"Yes, I do.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v11,"Then let us talk.","",Volkov

STRM_f02v12,"I had another disagreement with Frolov. He does not believe we are on the right path anymore.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v13,"What changed?","",Volkov
STRM_f02v14,"His wife died two years ago and he has not been himself ever since. He believes God punished him for his past and took her away.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v15,"He regrets taking part in the first war. Loyalty is still deeply rooted in him, but it's shaken. I can't be certain of him anymore.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v16,"Then we should be ready to find a suitable alternative. Look around for some loyal and amibitous recruits. Frolov still prefers to command from the front, doesn't he?","",Volkov
STRM_f02v17,"Indeed.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v18,"If it comes down to it, we could arrange an accident. Nothing can come between us and Malden.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v19,"Of course. On another note, the people from Europe perform really well, actually. Chernikov does what he's told without question, Kaplinsky has a sharp mind and is loyal to me personally...","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v20,"That infamous tale of the convoy ambush in Afghanistan. I heard that one too many times.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v21,"They were about to drown him in those marshes if I haven't arrived. I love the story myself.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v22,"Back to the topic at hand, Syomin is the newest. I am not yet completely sure, but given what we know...","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v23,"Observe him, but he shouldn't be an issue. Good, Zinovy, we are almost ready.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v24,"You keep saying that. For years now, actually.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v25,"Patience is a virtue. This time, I truly mean it. I believe we can start next year. There is one remaining topic - Lemontov.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v26,"Is he not in prison?","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v27,"A possibilty presented itself to get him out.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v28,"What? How?","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v29,"KGB recently captured western spies in Moscow. They were not able to get anything useful out of them, but the US is keen on getting them back.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v30,"They are willing to exchange prisoners - Lemontov for their return.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v31,"Are you serious? Do agree?","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v32,"I can't afford not to agree. Comrade Livanokh's right hand and a military genius - without him we have a chance to win, with him I am certain of victory.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v33,"Do you not believe me to pull my weight?","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v34,"Of course, Zinovy, but this is Lemontov we speak of. Forget your pride for once for the good of the plan.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v35,"It seems I am to be replaced and I don't like it.","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v36,"Don't be foolish. I don't trust Lemontov. He's been away for a long time and he spent all that with the enemy. I'm not about to hand him over the command of our forces.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v37,"No, rather we test him and use his abilities to our advantage - we don't have to involve him in our plans until much, much later.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v38,"That I can agree with, Vladimir. Although I still maintain we do not need him...","",Zubarev
STRM_f02v39,"I already made the choice, the exchange could happen in a few months time. I will return on that day to meet him personally.","",Volkov
STRM_f02v40,"In the meantime, follow the plan. We are on our way to changing the world forever.","",Volkov
