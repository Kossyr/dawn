STRM_x02v01,"How much time is this going to take?",,epgayd
STRM_x02v02,"At least a week, sir. We'll need to get more tanks in and that's going to take a while.",,steven
STRM_x02v03,"The Soviets are clearly playing for time. Maybe hoping for the winter to settle in and enable them to hold out in the north?",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v04,"Then we must push on, even without our strongest tanks. This war must be brought to a swift end!",,epgayd
STRM_x02v05,"I warned you James that attacking in the outset of winter is not the greatest idea...",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v06,"What other choice do we have, George? The Soviets would otherwise get reinforcements and fortify their positions even more.\nThis is the only certain way to victory.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v07,"We crushed them during the landings. We control the south. I say we march immediately north and get this done!",,steven
STRM_x02v08,"In the same manner as you got it done on Everon?",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v09,"Those far-right French militants were dangerous, unpredictable! I had to react before it got out of control.",,steven
STRM_x02v10,"Well, your reaction drew the Soviets in...",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v11,"And I kicked them out right after, what are you on about?",,steven
STRM_x02v12,"You lost twice as many men as us during the First Crisis....",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v13,"Fighting the Soviets for fuck sake!",,steven
STRM_x02v14,"Gentlemen, please. Everon is beyond us. The most radical of the French militants were dealt with and the island is finally in our hands. But now we must deal with the matter at hand.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v15,"Seven years ago, I stood in this very base and I led our army to great victory over the Soviets.\nWe got most of their high command and even that shit Livanoch. Kolguyev was ours.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v16,"And now we're back again. I feel like we didn't deal with the Soviets properly last time.\nKolguyev must not remain in their hands if we wish for peace.\nWho's saying they don't harbour right here any more of their SCUD launchers waiting to be used against us?\nIf we do not end this quickly, this may well turn again into a crisis of a global level.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v17,"Sir, we hear you. Let's deal with them, for the final time!",,steven
STRM_x02v18,"What do you propose, Steve?",,epgayd
STRM_x02v19,"Give me the command again, please sir. I will bring you Lemontov's head personally and put the island under your control.",,steven
STRM_x02v20,"Lemontov... It's been a while since I heard that name. Is it confirmed?",,epgayd
STRM_x02v21,"Yes, James, the intel is certain. He's been in Afghanistan for a few months but he's certainly here now. Possibly leading their army.",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v22,"Then we'll have to deal with him again. Maybe prison won't be enough this time...",,epgayd
STRM_x02v23,"James, if I may... give me the command. Johnson is reckless and what we need is slow and careful advance.\nCentral Kolguyev is full of mountains, forests and narrow passageways. It will be a different battle to the one we just fought...",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v24,"Sir, Dyaconsen is just afraid. A strong final push is what we need right now. Before the Soviets get more reinforcements.",,steven
STRM_x02v25,"I advise caution. We lost a lot already.",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v26,"And we'll lose even more if we delay! That's exactly what the Soviets want!",,steven
STRM_x02v27,"I don't want our casualties  to skyrocket. But I also don't want to give the Soviets any more time than is necessary.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v28,"George, you will target the enemy armour and equipment. Destroy as much as you can.\nI also place you in the charge of the central thrust.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v29,"Gladly, sir!",,dyaconsen
STRM_x02v30,"Steve, you will focus on the coastline and get as far north as possible. Once the tanks arrive, we'll make the final push there.",,epgayd
STRM_x02v31,"Understood, sir!",,steven
STRM_x02v32,"Gentlemen, let this crisis be the very last we have to endure. We shall kick the Soviets out once and for all!",,epgayd
