<b>2nd February 1989</b> - Dearest Ekaterina,
<br><br>
this is the eighteenth letter I am writing to you since your last answer. My comrades keep telling me that I am a fool and that I worry for nothing. I trust my feelings though and I feel that something is amiss. I'll keep nagging the postmaster until ke spills the truth. If there is an issue, and I believe there is, he surely knows about it.
<br><br>
Since my last letter, I have flown in the latest attack helicopter model and participated in a somewhat dangerous mission. You don't have to worry, I was not injured unlike many others. I saved a trapped squad and afterwards befriended their commander, Sergey Rashiv. I hope one day I am able to introduce you to him.
<br><br>
One last attack separates us from victory. Today, the war should finally end. I might have to remain here for a few weeks before I'm given a leave, but like I promised, I would return the moment I am able to. And that moment might not be so far off now.
<br><br>
I hope I will have good news for you in my next letter. 
<br><br>
Forever yours,<br>
Nikolay
