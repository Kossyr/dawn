   <b>4.11.1986</b> - I made a good impression on the officer. He called for me and recommended to the Spetsnaz. Few hours later and I am on my way to Lamentin.
<br><br>
I am assigned to major Lemontov. Grigory Lemontov - I know that name. He used to be a colonel, but then he also spent the last seven years in American prison. I must confess I did not even know he was back. That man is legendary, his reputation is of ruthless and cunning man. He saw all the battlefields of the world - Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, Columbia, South Africa... He is a legend among the troops and for a good reason - he is one of the best soldiers our Motherland can boast. 
<br><br>
I should feel honoured. And yet I don't. Lemontov actually reminds of the old times. And those bring back painful memories. No, that's silly. I am silly. I am a soldier and this is my newest mission. Forget all other crap for one night and focus. This is my chance to actually get somewhere.
<br><br>
Let's get to it.

	Rashiv, you have been recommended by your commanding officer lieutenant Dostoevsky. I won't ask about your qualities, you shall demonstrate them to me now.
<br><br>
    Our goal is to seize <a href="marker:Lamentin">Lamentin</a>. We need to encircle the city first and then strike. We have surprise and the morning shadow on our side.
    <br><br>
    We will join other Spetsnaz before the operation starts. Our first target is the <a href="marker:Harbour">harbour</a>. Squad <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a> supports us from the sea. Next we take control of the roads by seizing <a href="marker:CheckpointSouth">checkpoints</a> and the <a href="marker:Outpost">outpost</a>. We will be joined by squad <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a> from the north.
    <br><br>
    Me and you will then move to the <a href="marker:Outlook">lookout</a> from where we shall coordinate the attack and support it with my long range sniper rifle. You will cover me. The fall of <a href="marker:Lamentin">Lamentin</a> will be only a question of time.
    <br><br>
    We start <a href="marker:Start">southeast</a> of the city. Good luck, Rashiv.
