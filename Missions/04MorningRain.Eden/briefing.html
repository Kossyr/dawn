   <b>4.11.1986</b> - I made a good impression on the officer. He called for me and recommended to the Spetsnaz. I should feel honoured. I guess I am a little. My head is still clouded with doubt and remorse, but at least there is an interesting mission ahead.
<br><br>
As a ten man squad we are to seize Lamentin. Fortunately, I am only in reserve and will probably just guard the road and forest to the east rather than be personally involved in the combat.
<br><br>
Perhaps it is better that way. It will be pretty hot in that city, which I won't have to endure laying in the bushes...

	Rashiv, you have been recommended by your commanding officer lieutenant Dostoevsky. I won't ask about your qualities, you shall demonstrate them to me now.
<br><br>
Our starting position is <a href="marker:start">near</a> Lamentin. 
    </p>
   <hr>  
   <p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Continue with Spetsnaz squad Dimitri to the outskirts of the city. There you will split up, the squad shall go on to <a href="marker:poziceKal">position Kalinka</a>, you and Lemontov to <a href="marker:lezel">position Bear</a>, where he'll leave you.</p>
   <hr>
      <p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>While Lemontov makes his way to <a href="marker:poziceDragunov">position Dragunov</a>, you will watch the road and forest east of Lamentin. Do not let the enemy surround major Lemontov and provide cover for the squad.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Destroy the APC coming along the northern road.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Listen to major Lemontov and follow his orders.</p>
