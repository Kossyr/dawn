<b>4th November 1988</b> - I made a good impression on the officer. He called for me and recommended me to the spetsnaz. Few hours later, I am on my way to Lamentin.
<br><br>
I am assigned to major Grigory Lemontov - I know that name. He fought in the conflict here years ago but was captured by the Americans and spent years in their prison. I must confess I haven't even known he was back.
<br><br>
I'm hoping it was my skills that made lieutenant Dostoevsky choose me and not my name alone. If I was ever waiting for a chance to prove myself, this is it.

Rashiv, you have been recommended by your commanding officer lieutenant Dostoevsky. I won't ask about your qualities, you shall demonstrate them to me now.
<br><br>
Our goal is to seize <a href="marker:Lamentin">Lamentin</a>. We need to encircle the city first and then strike. We have surprise and the morning shadow on our side.
<br><br>
We will join other spetsnaz before the operation starts. Our first target is the <a href="marker:Harbour">harbour</a>. Squad <a href="marker:Ivan">Ivan</a> supports us from the sea. Next we take control of the roads by seizing <a href="marker:CheckpointSouth">checkpoints</a> and the <a href="marker:Outpost">outpost</a>. We will be joined by squad <a href="marker:Yelena">Yelena</a> from the north.
<br><br>
Me and you will then move to the <a href="marker:Outlook">lookout</a> from where we shall coordinate the attack and support it with my long range sniper rifle. You will cover me. The fall of <a href="marker:Lamentin">Lamentin</a> will be only a question of time.
<br><br>
We start <a href="marker:Start">south-east</a> of the city. Good luck, Rashiv.
