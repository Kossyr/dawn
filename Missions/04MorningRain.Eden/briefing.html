   <b>4.11.1986</b> - I made a good impression on the officer. He called for me and recommended to the Spetsnaz. I should feel honoured. I guess I am a little. My head is still clouded with doubt and remorse, but at least there is an interesting mission ahead.
<br><br>
As a ten man squad we are to seize Lamentin. Fortunately, I am only in reserve and will probably just guard the road and forest to the east rather than be personally involved in the combat.
<br><br>
Perhaps it is better that way. It will be pretty hot in that city, which I won't have to endure laying in the bushes...
