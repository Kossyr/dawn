<b>3rd December 1987</b> - Day one of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
I finished basic training yesterday - and today I'm already a tank commander! Just one tank at the moment and T72 at that - a piece of old shit to be honest. Slower than T80, bad recoil, consumes more fuel and the engine makes sounds like it's about to give up on life. The newer models were sent to Afghanistan and we are stuck with these old ones. I hope I get in T80 as soon as possible. Once there, it's only a small step to my own platoon...

Yesterday, comrades from infantry managed not only to repel an enemy assault but also to advance into the enemy territory. They will not be able to hold their positions without tank support and that's where you come in.
<br><br>
You start at the <a href="marker:start">Don base</a>.

<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Get in your tank as a driver and go to the <a href="marker:rota">Dnieper base</a> close to the front where the rest of your platoon - call sign Yuri - is waiting for you.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Together with Yuri platoon continue to <a href="marker:zakladna">Astrabirsk</a> and help our units defend their positions.</p>
