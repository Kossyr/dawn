<b>3rd December 1988</b> - Day one of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
I finished basic training yesterday - and today I'm already part of a tank platoon! 
<br><br>
My luck seems off the charts lately. First the promotion to tank commander and now a battle hardened tank corps under comrade major Frolov himself! It could not have gone any better!
<br><br>
Well, by the looks of it, I did get T72 as my tank - a piece of old shit to be honest. Slower than T80, bad recoil, consumes more fuel and the engine roars like a flock of dinosaurs. I hope I get in T80 as soon as possible.
<br><br>
If I perform well, surely better equipment and promotion await. Platoon leader - that's my goal and I take nothing less. Let's show everyone what Dmitry Kukushkin is capable of!

Yesterday, comrades from infantry managed not only to repel an enemy assault but also to advance into the enemy territory. They will not be able to hold their positions without tank support and that's where you come in.
<br><br>
You shall join the tank corps of comrade major Frolov. Your task is to support our frontline positions and repel any enemy armour that might try to retake <a href="marker:zakladna">Astrabirsk</a>.
<br><br>
You start at the <a href="marker:start">Don base</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Get in your tank as a driver with comrade Frolov as the commander and get to the <a href="marker:rota">Dnieper base</a> close to the front where the rest of the platoon - call sign Yury - is waiting.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Together with platoon Yury continue to <a href="marker:zakladna">Astrabirsk</a> and support our units.</p>
<hr>   
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Destroy the incoming tanks from the <a href="marker:SouthernAttack">southern road</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Defend <a href="marker:zakladna">Astrabirsk</a> against the attack from <a href="marker:NorthernAttack">the north</a>.</p>

<br>
<p>You did well, comrade Kukushkin. Our tank platoon proved their mettle today. The enemy will think twice before attacking again. Good work, comrade!</p>
