STRM_09v01,"Are you certain he mentioned Kolguyev specifically?","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v02,"Yes comrade captain, more than certain. They were pretty clear in their intentions.","",rashiv
STRM_09v03,"At least we can be sure the attack is coming but the problem is we are far from ready to fight them off.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v04,"We are understaffed, underequipped and right now seriously lacking any morale. If they come tomorrow we won't hold for a week.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v05,"I thank you for your information, comrade. And how you managed to get out of Everon.\nI think you deserve a promotion at the very least, corporal!","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v06,"Thank you, comrade captain!","",rashiv
STRM_09v07,"I'll bring this up with my superiors. You go catch some breath. You deserve it.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v08,"Comrade captain, there is one thing I wanted to bring up...","",rashiv
STRM_09v09,"The rebels, they... they made it pretty clear they did not ask for help and did not see me as an ally.\nIf our goals hadn�t aligned I would say they might as well have shot me.","",rashiv
STRM_09v10,"I can't say much about this, comrade, but you are a bright fellow and can put the pieces together.\nKnow that I have been told the same.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v11,"This must have come from way above. I wouldn't mention it if I were you.\nIt would be better if we have never talked about it but.. I can promise I will look into it.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v12,"Thank you comrade captain. I am simply concerned...","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v13,"I know soldier, but we cannot do much about this right now. We have a problem on our hands that we must see to.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_09v14,"I like you, Rashiv. Next time we speak, I'll hopefully tell you more.\nFor now, dismissed!","",shaposhnikov

STRM_09v15,"Rise and shine, Sergei! It's time for your night shift.\nFollow me! I'll give you a ride!","",yashin
STRM_09v16,"What a lovely alarm clock...","",rashiv
STRM_09v17,"It's so dark I can't even see your car.","",rashiv
STRM_09v18,"Hold on, I'll turn the lights on!","",yashin

STRM_09v19,"Slept well?","",yashin
STRM_09v20,"Hardly. Kept waking up.","",rashiv
STRM_09v21,"Yeah, I got you. The island is shrouded in a general sense of nervous anticipation and a chilling fear of incoming attack.","",yashin
STRM_09v22,"Couldn't have said better myself, Vadim. But it is freezing!","",rashiv
STRM_09v23,"You'll get warmer by the fire. It must be below zero at this point, although there is still no snow.\nI guess we won't get snowy Christmas for another year.","",yashin
STRM_09v24,"If we even get there, Vadim. How's the situation at home, any news?","",rashiv
STRM_09v25,"Still nothing official. There are rumoured reinforcements, but if they were sent they would be here long ago.\nKreml doesn't seem to be able to agree on anything so they pretty much left us to our own devices...","",yashin
STRM_09v26,"I'm surprised the international community didn't do anything. Or does no one care?","",rashiv
STRM_09v27,"Care for what?\nFew communists getting wrecked by NATO on godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere?\nI'd be surprised if this was even in the news.","",yashin
STRM_09v28,"Similar thing happened here seven years ago, and that caught their attention.","",rashiv
STRM_09v29,"Yeah because Livanoch had a nuclear arsenal at his disposal. We would be glad for T80s at this point.","",yashin

STRM_09v30,"Finally, a relief. I was bored out of my mind I tell you! Almost fell asleep an hour ago.","",relief
STRM_09v31,"You'll get your sleep soon. Anything out of the ordinary?","",yashin
STRM_09v32,"Nah, so far so good. Although the patrols were doubled for this shift. There was some radio disturbance earlier in the night.","",relief
STRM_09v33,"Where is my partner if they were doubled?","",rashiv
STRM_09v34,"Sorry, it includes only bases and the shoreline. Lack of men.\nIt's going to be only you and the shilka.","",relief
STRM_09v35,"It's probably just a false alarm anyway. Like that one a week ago.","",yashin
STRM_09v36,"Possibly but keep your eyes peeled. It was targeting the southern sector.","",relief
STRM_09v37,"Right, let's go then. Hop in the car and I'll take you to your base.","",yashin
STRM_09v38,"Here, take these night visions and enjoy your shift.","",relief

STRM_09v39,"Here we are! Let's relief that guy!","",yashin
