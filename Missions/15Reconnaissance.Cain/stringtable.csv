STRM_15v01,"What the fuck were you thinking?","",lemontov
STRM_15v02,"Are you fucking mental or just plain stupid?","",lemontov
STRM_15v03,"It was an opoortunity and I took it, Lemontov!","",Zubarev
STRM_15v04,"Opportunity for what? You had barely enough men to hold that territory let alone take it!","",lemontov
STRM_15v05,"I... I may have undertaken a small risk, but victory gould give us ...","",Zubarev
STRM_15v06,"Nothing! We would just have to defend more territory with fewer men!","",lemontov
STRM_15v07,"The offensive war partial success as the enemy suffered losses...","",Zubarev
STRM_15v08,"You took out few of their light tanks and one base. Excellent job.","",lemontov
STRM_15v09,"Don't ridicule me, Lemontov! As if you would have done any better!","",Zubarev
STRM_15v10,"I told you, Zubarev, that we have to be on the defensive.\nWe are outnumbered and have to lure the enemy to narrow passes and rough terrain, that is our advantage!","",lemontov
STRM_15v11,"The great Russian bear does not sit idle in the hills while the enemy surrounds him!\nOur attack today delayed them and made them change their plans! They will have to rebuild...","",Zubarev
STRM_15v12,"No, you lost us central Kolguyev today, that's what you did you fucking moron!","",lemontov
STRM_15v13,"Comrades, please. The whole camp can hear you arguing. It's not good for the morale.","",lemontov
STRM_15v14,"I'm done talking anyway. You know Lemontov, I am not sure why Volkov even allowed you back in the army.\nYou lack vision ever since Livanoch's death and that prison time hasn't done you any good.\nOnce Volkov arrives I'll personally request you to be stripped of your rank and sent back to Russia, in chains preferrably.","",Zubarev
STRM_15v15,"Pompous prick. I hate that asshole. Why is he in command here again?","",lemontov
STRM_15v16,"Because he's Volkov aide and supports everything he says before the Kreml? Also married to his daughter I believe?","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_15v17,"It's certainly not his military genius.","",lemontov
STRM_15v18,"You shouldn't have been so rough with him. He is powerful outside of battlefield and can make your life hell.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_15v19,"I'm too old to be bothered by political shit, Stas. Whatever he and Volkov might have in store for me was already decided.\nI'm running on a borrowed time here and I can't waste it sugar-coating my words with that shitface.","",Lemontov
STRM_15v20,"Huh, what the hell do we do with this mess? The next enemy offensive might push up to this base before I can stop it.","",Lemontov
STRM_15v21,"We're gonna have to improvise, Grigory. Let's recon a bit, see what they're planning. Then we can make a counter move.","",Shaposhnikov

STRM_15v22,"The last offensive didn't go so well I've been told. You hear anything, Sergei?","",yashin
STRM_15v23,"I've seen the plan and the reports. The assault was too ambitious and risky and the tanks were not given enough support.\nWe can be glad we didn't lose more.","",rashiv
STRM_15v24,"But what do we do now? We're holding less than half the island now. Are the reinforcements coming, comrade captain?","",yashin
STRM_15v25,"I am not at liberty to comment on that, comrade.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_15v26,"We'll know when they arrive, Vadim. For now we can only fight on. Heads up, we're entering enemy territory.","",rashiv
STRM_15v27,"You're starting to sound more and more like a commander, you know that Rashiv?","",shaposhnikov
STRM_15v28,"I learned from the best, captain.","",rashiv

STRM_15v29,"Holy shit, that is a lot of tanks. We can't hope to hold this!","",rashiv
