   <b>6.12.1986</b> - Still no message from Ekaterina. I'm starting to think that letters are not allowed out yet. Is the command keeping things here a secret or at least as much shrouded in mystery as possible? What the hell is going on here?
   <br><br>
   We got up early this morning. Our goal - reconnaissance. We need to know what the enemy is planning. The easiest to have a look. 
   <br><br>
   I've seen Lemontov when they woke us up. We only exchanged looks before he disappeared in the morning mist. He's in forward positions deep behind enemy lines. Life of Spetsnaz - always exciting.

   Today's objective is to scout enemy positions. Two main targets are the bases codenamed <a href="marker:baseTortoise">Tortoise</a> and <a href="marker:baseDeer">Deer</a>. The enemy has setup a number of forward camps in the hills so you'll have to fight your way through. Your squad Roman is heading <a href="marker:EllipseArea">north</a> up to base <a href="marker:baseDeer">Deer</a>, meanwhile squad Konstantin handles the <a href="marker:EllipseArea2">south</a> and base <a href="marker:baseTortoise">Tortoise</a>.

   Squad Dmitri is in <a href="marker:EllipseLemontov">forward position</a> and is also the leader of this operation.
