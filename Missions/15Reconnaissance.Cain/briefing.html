    <b>6.12.1986</b> - We got up early this morning. Our goal - reconnaissance. We need to know what the enemy is
    planning. The easiest to have a look.
    <br><br>
    I've seen Lemontov when they woke us up. We only exchanged looks before he disappeared in the morning mist. He's in
    forward positions deep behind enemy lines. Life of Spetsnaz - always exciting.

    Today's objective is to scout enemy positions. The two main targets are the bases <a href="marker:baseTortoise">in
      the north</a> and <a href="marker:baseDeer">in the south</a>. The enemy has set up a number of forward camps in
    the hills so you'll have to fight your way through. Your squad Roman is heading to the <a
      href="marker:EllipseArea">northern sector</a> and the <a href="marker:baseDeer">local base</a>, meanwhile squad
    Konstantin handles the <a href="marker:EllipseArea2">southern sector</a> and the <a href="marker:baseTortoise">local
      base</a>.
    <br>
    Squad Dmitri is in <a href="marker:EllipseLemontov">forward position</a> and is also the leader of this operation.
    <br><br>
    Mission starts at the <a href="marker:start">base</a>.
