STRM_11v01,"If someone told me seven years ago that one day my life would be saved by a Soviet soldier, I would laugh to his face.","",Astier
STRM_11v02,"But we live in strange times where nightmares become reality and dreams are clouded in darkness and uncertainty.","",Astier
STRM_11v03,"The fate of the island was one of a calm, peaceful nation full of simple people minding their small problems.\nBut destiny is a fickle lady.","",Astier
STRM_11v04,"Seven years ago, our freedom was challenged. We fought for it, but were betrayed.\nThe sickle and hammer hit hard. No stone was left unturned, no soul left unscathed, our dignity belittled and our pride shattered.","",Astier
STRM_11v05,"But we prevailed. We returned to prosperity and normality. We believed in peace. But sometimes it is not enough.","",Astier
STRM_11v06,"We are challenged once more, another was upon us. What is our desitny if not to suffer?\nWhat has fate left for us but to fight superior enemy and watch our homeland burn?","",Astier
STRM_11v07,"I am sorry for your people, commander.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v08,"It was you and your ilk who brought that suffering upon us. Again.","",Astier

STRM_11v16,"I do. And I've been told you are the only one who can help me.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v17,"Hm, the enemy has total control of both sea and air. It won't be easy to get past all the patrols.\nOnly a boat is a possible escape vehicle but you still have to get to Kolguyev in one piece...","",Astier
STRM_11v18,"I just need you to point me in a direction. I will go on alone if need be.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v19,"Nonsense, you wouldn't get far. I did have an idea in mind but never actually dared to pursue it.\nBut maybe you are crazy enough to do it.","",Astier
STRM_11v20,"If you don't see any other way... what needs to be done?","",Rashiv
