STRM_11v01,"If someone told me seven years ago that one day my life would be saved by a Soviet soldier, I would laugh to his face.","",Astier
STRM_11v02,"But we live in strange times where nightmares become reality and dreams are clouded in darkness and uncertainty.","",Astier
STRM_11v03,"The fate of the island was one of a calm, peaceful nation full of simple people minding their small problems.\nBut destiny is a fickle lady.","",Astier
STRM_11v04a,"Seven years ago, our freedom was challenged. We fought for it, but were betrayed.","",Astier
STRM_11v04b,"The sickle and hammer hit hard. No stone was left unturned, no soul left unscathed, our dignity belittled and our pride shattered.","",Astier
STRM_11v05,"But we prevailed. We returned to prosperity and normality. We believed in peace. But sometimes it is not enough.","",Astier
STRM_11v06,"We are challenged once more, another war upon us. What is our destiny if not to suffer?\nWhat has fate left for us but to fight a superior enemy and watch our homeland burn?","",Astier
STRM_11v07,"I am sorry for your people, commander.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v08,"It was you and your ilk who brought that suffering upon us. Again.","",Astier
STRM_11v09,"We were told to come and help the local government to reclaim the island. I did not know...","",Rashiv
STRM_11v10,"That the local government did not ask for your help and your presence here is basically an invasion?","",Astier
STRM_11v11,"If it means anything, I am sorry for that.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v12,"I appreciate it. You are not responsible for the actions of your government,\nbut it is still somewhat uncomfortable welcoming you inside the walls of our castle.","",Astier
STRM_11v13,"No matter. My name is Gaston Astier, the commander of the Everon forces.","",Astier
STRM_11v14,"Sergei Rashiv, the Soviet Army.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v15,"I know you helped my men. I know you helped me. You probably seek a way out of here, correct?","",Astier
STRM_11v16,"I do. And I've been told you are the only one who can help me.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v17,"Hm, the enemy has total control of both sea and air. It won't be easy to get past all the patrols.\nOnly a boat is a possible escape vehicle but you still have to get to Kolguyev in one piece...","",Astier
STRM_11v18,"I just need you to point me in a direction. I will go on alone if need be.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v19,"Nonsense, you wouldn't get far. I did have an idea in mind but never actually dared to pursue it.\nBut maybe you are crazy enough to do it.","",Astier
STRM_11v20,"If you don't see any other way... what needs to be done?","",Rashiv
STRM_11v21,"I have the necessary gear downstairs. Let's go.","",Astier

STRM_11v22,"You can't be serious.","",Calvet
STRM_11v23,"We're going to get Rashiv back to Kolguyev. Let's go, men!","",Astier

STRM_11v24,"It is time. Follow me.","",Astier
STRM_11v25,"We're taking the car. I drive.","",Astier

STRM_11v26,"The plan's simple. We need to get you on a boat. There's a port in Saint Pierre which will provide us with one.","",Astier
STRM_11v27,"The boats are well guarded so we'll need to create a distraction. We infiltrate the base, find explosives and blow up their supplies.","",Astier
STRM_11v28,"It should give you enough opportunity to seize one of the boats and get out of the port before anyone realizes what is going on.","",Astier
STRM_11v29,"We are disguised as members of the squad that attacked our castle. We will use their identity to get to Saint Pierre.\nI'm officer O'Lathley and you are my subordinate Jason Twombly.","",Astier
STRM_11v30,"How is your English anyway?","",Rashiv
STRM_11v31,"I spent several years with American troops in Africa. What about you?","",Astier
STRM_11v32,"Well...","",Rashiv
STRM_11v33,"Try something.","",Astier
STRM_11v34,"My mother always buys apples from the market?","",Rashiv
STRM_11v35,"Hm, right.. try to talk as least as possible. I'll handle the rest, don't worry.","",Astier
STRM_11v36,"This is a crazy idea...","",Rashiv
STRM_11v37,"Relax. And forget the French, we're here.","",Astier

STRM_11v38,"Halt! Your unit?","",Guard
STRM_11v39,"Captain O'Lathley, Fifth Regiment. We're reporting from our assault on the castle.","",Astier
STRM_11v40,"Oh, I didn't recognize you. Welcome back, guys. Did you get them?","",Guard
STRM_11v41,"Mostly, but there are more in the mountains. We'll flush them out yet.","",Astier
STRM_11v42,"The colonel said he wanted a word with you, he's in his tent at the far end of the city,\nalthough he might be on inspection. You can go on.","",Guard

STRM_11v43,"The colonel?! How do we handle him? He'll see right through us!","",Rashiv
STRM_11v44,"Easy there, Russian. Don't forget your mission - get to the boats in any way you can. You got this.","",Astier

STRM_11v45,"Captain O'Lathley, welcome back, sir!","",Guard
STRM_11v46,"At ease, sergeant!","",Astier
STRM_11v47,"Sir, the colonel asked me to show you the newest operation plans. He unfortunately had to leave for Saint Phillipe.","",Guard
STRM_11v48,"That is a shame. Let's go to his tent, then. Twombly, you are free until I am back. Enjoy your time.","",Astier
STRM_11v49,"This way, sir.","",Guard

STRM_11v50,"Hey, you, you look like you're not doing anything. Find Calverra and get his lazy ass to refuel the boats.\nI can't find that idiot and I have better things to do.","",Officer
STRM_11v51,"If the boats are not fuelled, then I cannot get out of here even if I steal one. I have to find Calverra.","",Rashiv

STRM_11v52,"I'm looking for Calverra.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v53,"Don't know the guy, sorry.","",Someone
STRM_11v54,"I saw him drunk yesterday. He was singing Ave Maria for the whole two hours. Don't know where he is though.","",Someone
STRM_11v55,"I know him. But I don't know where he is.","",Someone
STRM_11v56,"No idea, mate. Ask someone else.","",someone
STRM_11v57,"Stop bothering me, will you?","",someone
STRM_11v58,"Go bother someone else.","",someone
STRM_11v59,"Frankly, I don't really care where that drunken asshole is.","",someone
STRM_11v60,"Calverra you say? I think I saw him by the pub.","",Someone

STRM_11v61,"He went outside to piss.","",someone

STRM_11v62,"Are you Calverra?","",Rashiv
STRM_11v63,"Oh shit, did the sergeant finally send someone after me?\nMan, I know about the fuel shortage, but I cannot do anything about it. ","",Calverra
STRM_11v64,"You see, I owe some money to few fine gentlemen from logistics.\nI may have lost to them in cards a few times. Hm, actually, many times.","",Calverra
STRM_11v65,"The thing is they want their money back but I can't give what I don't have, see?\nSo they are not willing to give me the fuel truck.","",Calverra
STRM_11v66,"But don't worry, sooner or later some officer will step down and order the truck to be moved.","",Calverra
STRM_11v67,"The fuel is needed now.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v68,"In that case, you can try to get the fuel truck from Durras yourself.\nAsk for Tracer, tell him Calverra sent you and bring it back here. I'll wait for you by the beach.","",Calverra
STRM_11v69,"I can't wait for this mess to sort itself out. I'll have to get the fuel from Durras.","",Rashiv

STRM_11v70,"You look like someone from Calverra. Did he send you for the fuel truck?","",Tracer
STRM_11v71,"Yes.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v72,"Well, I want my money. Do you have my money?","",Tracer
STRM_11v73,"No.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v74,"Tough luck then. Tell Calverra to come himself with the money, otherwise he can say goodbye to the fuel.","",Tracer
STRM_11v75,"And if you're thinking about telling the officers - don't. They have other things to deal than a few mothballed boats.","",Tracer

STRM_11v76,"He won't give me the truck. I'll have to steal it...","",Rashiv

STRM_11v77,"What are you doing, skulking around like that? Get out of here.","",Guard

STRM_11v78,"Watch out, he's taking the truck!","",Guard
STRM_11v79,"Calverra's bitch!","",Tracer

STRM_11v80,"Did you just try to steal the truck? Get out of here, seriously.","",Tracer

STRM_11v81,"Now back to Calverra...","",Rashiv

STRM_11v82,"Hey, good work, man. How did you persuade Tracer?","",Calverra
STRM_11v83,"Actually, I'd rather not know. Thanks for the fuel, I'll make sure the boats are fuelled up!","",Calverra

STRM_11v84,"This looks like a supply warehouse. I might find the explosives here...","",Rashiv

STRM_11v85,"Hey you, back off. Until the quartermaster gets back, no one is to poke around in the warehouse.","",Warehouse guard
STRM_11v86,"If you need a weapon or bullets, wait until morning. Now make yourself scarce!","",Warehouse guard

STRM_11v87,"How do I get inside? I need a distraction. I should look around.","",Rashiv

STRM_11v88,"No one is allowed inside! Piss off, private.","",Warehouse guard

STRM_11v89,"Piece of old crap. Where did I put the tools again?","",Angry man
STRM_11v90,"That tractor could do the trick...","",Rashiv

STRM_11v91,"Hey, what is that noise?","",Warehouse guards
STRM_11v92,"Can someone turn that off for fuck sake?","",Warehouse guards

STRM_11v93,"The fuel is taken care of. Now only to find the explosives.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v94,"I have the explosives. Now only to refuel the boats.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v95,"I have both the explosives and the boats refuelled. Now to find Gaston.","",Rashiv

STRM_11v96,"Hey, Rashiv, everything went according to plan?","",Astier
STRM_11v97,"Here are the explosives and the boats should be fuelled up. We can begin.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v98,"Excellent work, you're much more resourceful than it seemed.\nBut listen, I've been shown an interesting matter.","",Astier
STRM_11v99,"The Americans are preparing to attack Kolguyev.","",Astier
STRM_11v100,"What?!","",Rashiv
STRM_11v101,"Their plans are still in the early stages, so you have a few weeks at best. But they will come.","",Astier
STRM_11v102,"Then I have to get back to my army and warn them.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v103,"You do that, Rashiv, and as I said I'll help you. I'll set the charges and blow them up momentarily.\nOn my signal, you make a run for the boats. Got it?","",Astier
STRM_11v104,"I am ready.","",Rashiv
STRM_11v105,"Then let's go. And good luck, Rashiv.","",Astier

STRM_11r01,"RASHIV, GASTON HERE. MEET ME AT THE CEMETERY, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.","",Astier
STRM_11r02,"I SET THE CHARGES. GET READY, RASHIV!","",Astier
STRM_11r03,"THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, RASHIV! GO!","",Astier
STRM_11r04,"YOU MADE IT, RASHIV. WELL DONE. DON'T FORGET TO TELL ON KOLGUYEV THAT IT WAS THE RESISTANCE WHO HELPED YOU OUT.","",Astier
STRM_11r05,"HEY, RUSSIAN, THIS IS JEAN. AT FIRST, I OBVIOUSLY WASN'T REALLY A FAN OF YOU BUT YOU HELPED US OUT A LOT AND FOR THAT YOU HAVE MY GRATITUDE. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.","",Poincare
STRM_11r06,"SERGEI, PIERRE SENDS HIS REGARDS. IT WAS A BLAST FIGHTING ALONGSIDE YOU. I HOPE WE MEET AGAIN, FRIEND, AND I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP THAT LUCK OF YOURS BECAUSE MAN YOU HAVE APLENTY! BON VOYAGE AND FAREWELL!","",Calvet
STRM_11r07,"I WON'T FORGET, YOU GUYS, I PROMISE. YOU SAVED MY LIFE AND I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO REPAY MY DEBT.","",Rashiv
STRM_11r08,"DON'T FORGET, RASHIV, DESTINY IS IN YOUR HANDS. MAKE THE MOST OUT OF IT. EVERON OUT.","",Astier
