<b>9th November 1988</b> - Gaston Astier, the leader of the resistance, is willing to help me get out of here. He came up with a daring plan.
<br><br>
We assume the identities of some O'Lathley officer and private Twombly. At first I didn't think he was serious, but he told me to change uniform. I still am unsure if I am more amused or terrified.
<br><br>
The alternative is to give myself up which is the last thing on my mind. Being this close to the exit, I cannot back away now. I have to see this to the end.
<br><br>
My English is not the best, so I should talk as little as possible. Trying not to draw attention to us would also be preferable. God, the more I think about it, the more insane this plan sounds to me. What if we're caught? Will they shoot us on the spot or will we have time to surrender? I don't expect any mercy based on what I've seen until now.
<br><br>
I must be crazy, but I do not see any other way. I am no coward. I have come too far to fail.
<br><br>
Let's finally leave this island behind and return home.

Leaving Everon in the current climate is no easy feat, but there is certainly a way if one looks hard enough.
<br><br>
We have no air or naval vehicles to offer you, but our enemy has. There is a port nearby in <a href="marker:Port">Saint Pierre</a>. Using a disguise, we will inflitrate the local American base at which point you will have the opportunity to steal one of their boats and get back to Kolguyev.
<br><br>
We will have to create a distraction to lure most of the guards away from the beach - have a look around for some explosives so we can create enough mayhem for you to slip by and steal one of the boats.
<br><br>
We start at the <a href="marker:Start">castle courtyard</a>.

<p><a name="OBJ_6"></a>Tracer won't hand over the fuel truck. You'll have to steal it.</p>

<br>
<p>Finally, I escaped from Everon. It will take several hours to reach Kolguyev, but I am finally on my way. I need to bring the news of an invasion to my brothers - although I leave Everon behind, the war seems to be following still.</p>
