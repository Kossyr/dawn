<b>7th December 1988</b> - My name is Grigory Lemontov. I am a Soviet Spetsnaz. I have killed and bled for my country and I am ready to do so again in a heartbeat.
<br><br>
I have known Alexander Livanokh since I was a child. We were like brothers. I was always at his side, his right hand. I supported him. I fought for him.
<br><br>
I killed him.
<br><br>
Sometimes, I still dream of that day. I still dream of Blonski, Rashiv, Dyaconsen... Livanokh was my brother and I was forced to kill him. Then I spent seven years in a prison. For saving my country. For saving the United States. For saving the world.
<br><br>
I was sentenced to fifteen years. What kind of story has its hero chained and forgotten? Right, I am no hero. I did some things in life, some bad, evil things - I won't deny it. I believe the end justfiies the means. But sometimes, the means are too much to bear. I did not even know I had a line I was not willing to cross - and it took a lot to get there - but once I did, I knew what had to be done. I knew the consequences. I knew the reasons. Still, it destroyed me.
<br><br>
My life's purpose was to serve the Soviet Union alongside my brother, Alexander Livanokh. After he was gone, I felt empty, like I had no purpose. It took me years alone in a dark cell to slowly come back to my senses. Behind the walls of my prison there was still a fight going on. Politics never change, wars never stop. I was still needed. I wanted to go home, to set things right. Not knowing what occured in the aftermath of my capture made my nights sleepless.
<br><br>
The only thing I knew for fact was that there was no Third world war - yet. But time was ticking. I knew Livanokh had not worked alone. I knew I had to get back to make sure another crisis of this calibre never happens again.
<br><br>
It took long years, but finally, on the eve of my seventh year of imprisonment I was exchanged for some American spies captured in Moscow. It was supposed to be my return to freedom, but instead only my jailor changed. I was released to the opened arms of my enemies, even if they themselves did not fully realize it yet.
<br><br>
Vladimir Volkov was the new commander of Kolguyev. He reminded me of Livanokh - cold, calculating, smart and ruthless. He was dangerous and he knew me. He was one of Livanokh's former low-level officers. He climbed high and remained influential with the government and the high command. He was in the perfect position to execute Livanokh's old plan.
<br><br>
And I would sooner die than let that happen again.

<p><a name="Plan"></a>
The objective of this mission is to neutralize enemy armour in the <a href="marker:base">base</a>. The enemy is hoarding all kinds of tanks in there in an obvious preparation for a major offensive north. We must stop this attack before it even starts. The estimation is the enemy is planning to move in the morning so we have to deal with it this very night.
<br><br>
Comrade major, you command this mission. You are supported by <a href="marker:two">Two</a> and <a href="marker:three">Three</a>.
<br><br>
You start hidden in the <a href="marker:start">forest</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Two and Three shall sneak their way into the <a href="marker:base">base</a> and plant charges. On your command they will blow up the enemy tanks sky high.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: There are enemy patrols in the hills above the base. Try to take care of them.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: It would be nice if you also took care of a small <a href="marker:sklad">ammunition depot</a>. The enemy might be hiding there their AT and AA guns and we would rather they disappear off the map.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Finally, retreat to our <a href="marker:end">lines</a> and end the mission.</p>
