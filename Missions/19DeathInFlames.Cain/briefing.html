   <b>7th December 1987</b> - My name is Grigory Lemontov. I am a Soviet Spetsnaz. I have killed and bled for my country and I am ready to do so again in a heartbeat.
	<br><br>
	I have known Alexander Livanoch since I was a child. We were like brothers. I was always at his side, his right hand. I supported him. I fought for him.
   <br><br>
   I killed him.
   <br><br>
   Sometimes, I still dream of that day. I still dream of Blonski, Rashiv, Dyaconsen... Livanoch was my brother and I was forced to kill him. Then I spent seven years in a prison. For saving my country. For saving the United States. For saving the world.
   <br><br>
   I should be bitter. And maybe I was for a time, but not anymore. I had a lot of time to think while being captive. I recollected my thoughts, weighed my options and my loyalties. My "comrades" might think I wasn't given access to anything from the outside world while I was being a prisoner - but that cannot be further from the truth.
   <br><br>
   George made my accommodations quite comfortable and gave me plentiful access to information. I read books, magazines, newspapers, even watched TV from time to time. I knew what was happening in the world and I was disgusted. The lift of the curtain was hard for me. It struck me as a lighting bolt - all the forbidden knowledge kept out of the Soviet Union, all the new technology, which we were severely lacking, all the freedom that most ordinary people enjoy... Maybe that's why George did it - he knew that once I saw, once I experienced the other world, I cannot go back. And then they sent me back.
   <br><br>
   I just celebrated my seventh year of imprisonment when I was exchanged for some American spies captured in Moscow. I should have felt relief or even happiness, but a long lost feeling returned - bitterness. Once I saw my "comrades" in arms old memories came rushing back to the surface. I once again remembered Blonski, Rasiv and Livanoch and all those others that had to die that day. With bitterness soon came anger and that quickly turned into hatred. I hated what our nation represented. I hated how it treated its people. I hated that after killing my brother to stop a world ending disaster I only invited more of insane people to take charge of our nation.
   <br><br>
   Vladimir Volkov was the new Livanoch. He didn't have the full support of the army or the government, but he was close. He reminded me of Livanoch - cold, calculating, smart and ruthless. He was dangerous and I was sure our first meeting would be our last. But he restored me to my rank and sent me to Afghanistan. I can imagine better places for vacation, but it was far from the worst. I was still breathing, still living. And as I long as I lived I would keep on fighting.

	The objective of this mission is to neutralize enemy armour in the <a href="marker:base">base</a>. The enemy is hoarding all kinds of tanks in there in an obvious preparation for a major offensive north. We must stop this attack before it even starts. The estimation is the enemy is planning to move in the morning so we have to deal with it this very night.
<br><br>
Comrade major, you command this mission. You are supported by <a href="marker:two">Two</a> and <a href="marker:three">Three</a>.
<br><br>
You start hidden in the <a href="marker:start">forest</a>.
    </p>
   <hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Two and Three shall sneak their way into the <a href="marker:base">base</a> and plant charges. On your command they will blow up the enemy tanks sky high.</p>
<hr>
   <p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: There are enemy patrols in the hills above the base. Try to take care of them.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: It would be nice if you also took care of a small <a href="marker:sklad">ammunition depot</a>. The enemy might be hiding there their AT and AA guns and we would rather they disappear off the map.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Finally, retreat to our <a href="marker:end">lines</a> and end the mission.</p>
