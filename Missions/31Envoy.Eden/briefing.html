<b>2nd January 1988</b> - We won on Kolguyev against all odds. We defeated the enemy and captured many prisoners and equipment. We celebrated for a little while. Very little. It seems the smoke on the battlefield is yet to subdue and we are already on our next move.
<br><br>
Everon. It's been a while. But I am back with Lemontov with a seemingly simple mission - talk to the rebels and get them to join us in the upcoming attack. It's easier said than done.
<br><br>
They don't like us. We probably don't really like them either. But we do share a common enemy. There is just a slight problem - similar situation happened once before. We faced the same enemy back then - we supplied them with weapons, equipment, training. They were about to defeat the Americans before we showed up and smashed them to bits. 
<br><br>
Old grudges die hard. We betrayed them and some of those French still remember it. It will be hard to look past that and cooperate on anything. Even with their lives at stake they might refuse us and then there's nothing I can do for them anymore.
<br><br>
I vowed to help them. I vowed to come back. Now I am here, but what a mere man like me can do? Can I make sure the bloodshed ends? That we all get to return home and forget the squabble between us? What can I do but try my hardest? Will it be enough though?
<br><br>
If I falter now, the rebels are doomed. The orders are clear. They are with us or we will destroy them. Again.

You are going back to Everon, comrade lieutenant Rashiv. To pave a way for our liberation, you are to ensure the cooperation of the local resistance movement. Their information and knowledge of the enemy is invaluable to us. 
<br><br>
We would prefer them on our side in the upcoming attack. Appeal to their senses so they accept that they are either with us or they shall be destroyed alongside the Americans.
<br><br>
We are not making any more mistakes. This time Everon will be ours for good.
