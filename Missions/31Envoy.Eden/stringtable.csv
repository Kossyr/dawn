STRM_31v01,"The notes say an invasion should start by the end of January.",lemontov
STRM_31v02,"That's only a month's time. It's all happening so fast.",rashiv
STRM_31v03,"Events are beginning to unfold. We see that Volkov's plan has been put in motion. The first step is Everon.",lemontov
STRM_31v04,"We need to be watchful of what fate has Volkov prepared for this island - in the meantime, let us proceed with our mission.",lemontov
STRM_31v05,"What's the plan?",rashiv
STRM_31v06,"An invasion would be easier with the rebel's support. But we did screw over them once before.",lemontov
STRM_31v07,"I spent some time with them. We fought together. Even if we are not friends, they will hear me out at the very least.",rashiv
STRM_31v08,"That is why Volkov sent you here with me, no doubt. Your French is solid, I presume?",lemontov
STRM_31v09,"I would say so.",rashiv
STRM_31v10,"You will do the talking then. Set up a meeting with them and we'll go together.",lemontov

STRM_31v11,"Russian! I didn't think I'd see your face again.",poincare

STRM_31v13,"Sure, you should talk. He's waiting in the castle. Follow me.",poincare

STRM_31v14b,"Although I am glad to see you alive and well, Rashiv,\nit still brings certain uncomfort to welcome you again inside the walls of our castle.",astier
STRM_31v15a,"It's good to see you too, Gaston. This is Grigory Lemontov and we are here to offer you cooperation.",rashiv

STRM_31v18,"I'll handle it.",rashiv
STRM_31v19,"He does not. Is there something you want only me to hear?",rashiv

STRM_31v20b,"We understand the situation and we already have an answer for you.",astier
STRM_31v21a,"We know that we either help you or you will destroy us. We are not stupid.",astier

STRM_31v24b,"I am told that in the span of three months we shall leave you alone. We have no interest in the island once the Americans are gone.",rashiv
STRM_31v25a,"One can dream. I don't believe it shall be that simple, but it should give us time to regroup.",astier
STRM_31v25b,"Do tell your commanders we shall never surrender and if necessary, shall fight to the bitter end.",astier
STRM_31v26,"Now, as a sign of good will, here are some documents we collected about the enemy\n - their positions, defences and such - it could prove useful to your invasion plans.",astier
STRM_31v27,"You are wise, Gaston, thank you. I promise you, I will do my best to ensure we keep our end of the bargain. You have my word.",rashiv
STRM_31v28,"We trust you, Rashiv, but not your commanders. Make sure they understand fighting with us is not worth the hassle. If they keep their word, we shall keep ours.",Astier
STRM_31v29,"Good work, Sergey.",lemontov
