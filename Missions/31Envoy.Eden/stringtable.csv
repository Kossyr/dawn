STRM_31v01,"I never included your report in the official documents.","",lemontov
STRM_31v02,"How come Volkov is aware of my connection to the rebels then?","",rashiv
STRM_31v03,"I do not know. He's probably spying on us. He has many eyes and ears in the army.\nWwho knows what else he is aware of.","",lemontov
STRM_31v04,"We must be careful. Never underestimate your foe, Sergei, it only brings woes. Let's proceed one step at a time, starting with our mission.","",lemontov
STRM_31v05,"What's the plan?","",rashiv
STRM_31v06,"Attack on Everon would be easier with the rebel's support. But we did screw over them once before.","",lemontov
STRM_31v07,"I spent some time with them. We fought together. Even if we are not friends, they will hear me out at the very least.","",rashiv
STRM_31v08,"That is why Volkov sent you here with me, no doubt. Your French is solid, I presume?","",lemontov
STRM_31v09,"I would say so.","",rashiv
STRM_31v10,"You will do the talking then. Set up a meeting with them and we'll go together.","",lemontov

STRM_31v11,"Russian! I didn't think I'd see your face again.","",poincare
STRM_31v12,"It's good to see you, Jean. I promised I would be back and here we are. Can we talk with Gaston?","",rashiv
STRM_31v13,"Sure, you should talk. He's waiting in the castle. Follow me.","",poincare

STRM_31v14,"And so the Soviets return to our island once again. Third time's the charm as the saying goes.\nAlthough I am glad to see you alive and well, Rashiv, it still brings certain uncomfort to welcome you again inside the walls of our castle.","",astier
STRM_31v15,"It's good to see you too, Gaston. This is Grigory Lemontov and we are here to offer you cooperation.\nI promised to come back and set things right. It is time to resolve this war once and for all.","",rashiv
STRM_31v16,"You are indeed a man of your word. Tell me, does your comrade Lemontov speak French?","",astier
STRM_31v17,"Why are they looking at me?","",lemontov
STRM_31v18,"I'll handle it.","",rashiv
STRM_31v19,"He does not. Is there something you want only me to hear?","",rashiv
STRM_31v20,"I am going to be honest with you, Rashiv, and only you.\nWe expected you to come. Even you personally. We understand the situation and we already have an answer for you.","",astier
STRM_31v21,"We know that we either help you or you will destroy us. We are not stupid.\nWe spent the last decade defending our island against two of the greatest world powers yet we are still here.","",astier
STRM_31v22,"We did not get this far to simply surrender. We will help you in the invasion.\nGo straight to Malden for all we care.\nUse our airport, bases and ports. Win your war for all the good that might get you and leave.","",astier
STRM_31v23,"Then we shall have peace. This is the only way for us.","",astier
STRM_31v24,"I understand, Gaston. We are willing to provide you with weapons in exchange for your help and free usage of your airport.\nI am told that in the span of three months we shall leave you alone. We have no interest in the island once the Americans are gone.","",rashiv
STRM_31v25,"We are going to be on our guard, Rashiv. If we are betrayed, we shall fight once more. We will never surrender, but this you know.\nHopefully, we can cooperate for a while and once the dust settles we shall depart in peace.","",astier
STRM_31v26,"As a sign of good will, here are some documents we collected about the enemy\n - their positions, defences and such - it could prove useful to your invasion plans.\nOnce you land we shall help you fight.","",astier
STRM_31v27,"You are wise, Gaston, thank you. I promise you, I will do my best to ensure we keep our end of the bargain. You have my word.","",rashiv
STRM_31v28,"Good work, Sergei.","",lemontov

STRM_31v30,"Pierre? He's dead.","",astier
STRM_31v31,"Dead?","",rashiv
STRM_31v32,"We lose men every day. This castle ruin is everything we have left. This is what I did not want to show your command, only you.\nWe are close to our last breath, Rashiv, this might be our last chance to prevail...","",astier
STRM_31v33,"what was that? Jean, check the patrols! Everybody get to your posts!","",astier
STRM_31v34,"You should go, Rashiv. Get the documents back to your command.","",astier
