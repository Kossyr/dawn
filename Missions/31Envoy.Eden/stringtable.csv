STRM_31v01,"I never included your report in the official documents.","",lemontov
STRM_31v02,"How come Volkov is aware of my connection to the rebels then?","",rashiv
STRM_31v03,"I do not know. He's probably spying on us. He has many eyes and ears in the army.\nWwho knows what else he is aware of.","",lemontov
STRM_31v04,"We must be careful. Never underestimate your foe, Sergei, it only brings woes. Let's proceed one step at a time, starting with our mission.","",lemontov
STRM_31v05,"What's the plan?","",rashiv
STRM_31v06,"Attack on Everon would be easier with the rebel's support. But we did screw over them once before.","",lemontov
STRM_31v07,"I spent some time with them. We fought together. Even if we are not friends, they will hear me out at the very least.","",rashiv
STRM_31v08,"That is why Volkov sent you here with me, no doubt. Your French is solid, I presume?","",lemontov
STRM_31v09,"I would say so.","",rashiv
STRM_31v10,"You will do the talking then. Set up a meeting with them and we'll go together.","",lemontov

STRM_31v11,"Russian! I didn't think I'd see you again.","",poincare
STRM_31v12,"It's good to see you, Jean. I didn't think we would be back but the situation has changed. Can we talk with Gaston?","",rashiv
STRM_31v13,"Sure, you should talk. He's waiting in the castle. Follow me.","",poincare

STRM_31v14,"And so the Soviets return to our island once again. Third time's the charm as the saying goes.\nAlthough I am glad to see you alive and well, Rashiv, it still brings certain uncomfort to welcome you again inside our walls.","",astier
STRM_31v15,"It's good to see you too, Gaston. This is Grigory Lemontov and we are here to offer you cooperation.\nTogether we can kick the Americans out of Everon once and for all.","",rashiv
STRM_31v16,"Lemontov the Butcher? You keep an interesting company, Rashiv.\mWhat is this cooperation you speak of? Is it similar to the one we received seven years ago?","",astier
STRM_31v17,"That was unfortunate. Our commander at the time was a traitor and met his just end.\nWe are now returning to make things right for the island and finally return it to your hands.","",astier
STRM_31v18,"Lavish promises but we heard those before. Why should we trust you this time?","",astier
STRM_31v19,"You trusted me, Gaston. I thought we fought well side by side. Does that not make any difference?","",rashiv
STRM_31v20,"You are different, Rashiv. Although by the looks of it you were promoted you are still very fram from those high in the top.\nBelieve me, whatever ideas you have about your commanders, they are much worse than that.","",astier
strm_31v21,"Soviet leadership does not shine from sacrificing their own people for their goals. They lie, deceive, scheme.\nThe Soviet Union is not something we shall put our trust into ever again. We were burned once and we are not repeating our mistakes!","",astier
STRM_31v22,"Agreed!","",partisan
STRM_31v23,"They do not like us.","",rashiv
STRM_31v24,"I could have told you that before. Tell them what we want.","",lemontov
STRM_31v25,"I understand, Gaston, but hear me out. The Americans are not leaving Everon even though they retreated from Kolguyev.\nThey plan on staying. There will be no peace, they want to control you, they always wanted.","',rashiv
STRM_31v26,"How is your Union any different?","",poincare
STRM_31v27,"We should try and let bygones be bygones. Presently, we have no quarrel with you. Actually, we even have a common enemy.\nWe can fight together and win together. Only then will Everon know peace.","",rashiv
STRM_31v28,"What happens to us when you win?","",astier
STRM_31v29,"We are authorized to grant you amnesty for any past crimes you may have done to the Soviet Union. In exchange...","",rashiv
STRM_31v30,"In exchange for what?","",poincare
STRM_31v31,"That you do not seek any military or political position in the future establishment of Everon.","",rashiv
STRM_31v32,"You can't be serious.","",poincare
STRM_31v33,"Pathethic. How are you any different to the Americans? We lose our island no matter what, the only thing we can choose is our overlord.\nI spit on such arrengement..","",astier
STRM_31v34,"I expected better of you, Rashiv. Is it even you speaking or is that your beloved communist country?","",astier
STRM_31v35,"Ridiculous...","",partisan
STRM_31v36,"How stupid do they think we are?","",partisan
STRM_31v37,"They really do not like it. Some of them have unholstered their weapons.","",lemontov
STRM_31v38,"Keep calm and tell them the last part. We can handle this.","",lemontov
STRM_31v39,"We know the Americans seized most of your equipment. Once we secure the island we shall provide for you, that is part of the deal.","",rashiv
STRM_31v40,"Provide how?","",astier
STRM_31v41,"We are going to give youhelicopters, light tanks and boats. Newest models, no old scrap. Free of charge, as a gift to the people of Everon.\nWe only ask that our air forces are clear to utilise your airport.","",rashiv
STRM_31v42,"So let me get this straight. We are to help you retake the island.\nYou are going to install a puppet goverment with comunists in charge no doubt possibly not even Everonian and you are going to basically occupy our airport.","",astier
STRM_31v43,"In exchange for that, we are not going to get shot and we get some vehicles to drive around.\nIs that really it? Is that all that the mighty Soviet Union could muster? What a silly joke","",astier
STRM_31v44,"It is outrageous of you to think we would sell our island, our pride and dignity away. We will never agree to such a deal\nWe are going to fight on if we must but at least we shall remain free.","",astier
STRM_31v45,"For old time's sake, I am not going to shoot you, although I very much like that. You ar eno logner welcome here\nand if you want to seize Everon you will have to fight us too!","",astier
STRM_31v46,"Everon is free!","",poincare
STRM_31v47,"Alright, we heard enough. Let's get the shit off the table and face some facts here.\nYou keep talking about fighting but you cower in a castle ruin hoping the Americans won't attack and wipe you out.","",lemontov
STRM_31v48,"You have barely enough men to keep this rebellion going. I asume we see most of them here.\nYou are acting tough but you do not have many cards to play with.","",lemontov
STRM_31v49,"Yes, we screwer over you once before. And the Americans did that before that. You are always screwed over, because you are a small island which cannot possibly care for itself.\nWhat we offer is a level of protection that will bring you peace in the long term.\nSwallow your pride and face it - you are lost without us.","",lemontov
STRM_31v50,"Such insolance!","",astier
STRM_31v51,"I haven't finished. Face the facts for once, Astier - we are going back to Everon whether you help us or not. We will reclaim the island.\nYou can either be on the winning side and get something out of it or we will crush you and your dream of free Everon will go unfulfilled.","",lemontov
STRM_31v52,"Are you threatening us?","",astier
STRM_31v53,"Yes, I am, since you are not listening to reason. Face it, Everonians - your island is doomed if you continue on your path.\nI am telling you to wake up and see it. See that you cannot survive on your own any longer.","",lemontov
STRM_31v54,"Face it - either you accept the deal and and preserve Everon - not in the way you wanted - but preserve... Or continue in your senseless fight and lose verything. I cannot guaruntee there will be Everon once this is all over if you do not face the truth.","",lemontov
STRM_31v55,"You should have told me you speak French. And didn't you just killed us?","",rashiv
STRM_31v56,"No, I opened their eyes.","",lemontov
STRM_31v57,"Never thought I would listen to and agree with the infamous Lemontov. I should shoot you where you stand but I am no fool.\nI know you are right.","",astier
STRM_31v58,"We are proud people but we must know when to bow our heads at least for a while - to preserve what we built here. To safeguard future generations.","',astier
STRM_31v59,"We will help you retake Everon, Soviets. But i only do this for my men - if you break the deal I'll make sure to find you and personally gut your heart out.","",astier
STRM_31v60,"We have no interest in deceiving you, Astier. We would not offer the deal if we did not plan on keeping it. We are no Livanoch.","",lemontov
STRM_31v61,"I hope I do not live to regret this. Here, we gathered a lot of documents on the enemy - fortifications, bases, positions and defences - it could prove useful to your invasion plans.","",Astier
STRM_31v62,"This is indeed useful, thank you, Gaston. I promise you, I will personally make sure we keep our end of the bargain. You have my word.","",rashiv
STRM_31v63,"I trust you, Rashiv. Pierre always praised you, I should not have let my prejudice to cloud my judgment.","",astier
STRM_31v64,"Where is Pierre anyway?","",rashiv
STRM_31v65,"Pierre is dead.","',astier
STRM_31v66,"Dead?","",rashiv
STRM_31v67,"We lose men every day. It is a war that cost us much and it seems it will cost us everything in the end.\nI used to believe.. what was that? Jean, check the patrols!","",astier
STRM_31v68,"You should go, Rashiv. Get these documents back to your command.","",astier


STRM_31r01,"THAT MUST BE OUR CONTACT OVER THERE, BY THE FIRE.","",lemontov
STRM_31r02,"GO BACK TO THE BOAT, SERGEI, AND GET THOSE DOCUMENTS BACK TO KOLGUYEV. I'M GOING TO LEND THESE GUYS A HAND. OUT.","",lemontov
