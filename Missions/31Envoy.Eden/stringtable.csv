STRM_31v01,"I never included your report in the official documents.","",lemontov
STRM_31v02,"How come Volkov is aware of my connection to the rebels then?","",rashiv
STRM_31v03,"I do not know. He's probably spying on us. He has many eyes and ears in the army.\nWwho knows what else he is aware of.","",lemontov
STRM_31v04,"We must be careful. Never underestimate your foe, Sergei, it only brings woes. Let's proceed one step at a time, starting with our mission.","",lemontov
STRM_31v05,"What's the plan?","",rashiv
STRM_31v06,"Attack on Everon would be easier with the rebel's support. But we did screw over them once before.","",lemontov
STRM_31v07,"I spent some time with them. We fought together. Even if we are not friends, they will hear me out at the very least.","",rashiv
STRM_31v08,"That is why Volkov sent you here with me, no doubt. Your French is solid, I presume?","",lemontov
STRM_31v09,"I would say so.","",rashiv
STRM_31v10,"You will do the talking then. Set up a meeting with them and we'll go together.","",lemontov

STRM_31v11,"Russian! I didn't think I'd see your face again.","",poincare
STRM_31v12,"It's good to see you, Jean. I promised I would be back and here we are. Can we talk with Gaston?","",rashiv
STRM_31v13,"Sure, you should talk. He's waiting in the castle. Follow me.","",poincare

STRM_31v14,"And so the Soviets return to our island once again. Third time's the charm as the saying goes.\nAlthough I am glad to see you alive and well, Rashiv, it still brings certain uncomfort to welcome you again inside our walls.","",astier
STRM_31v15,"It's good to see you too, Gaston. This is Grigory Lemontov and we are here to offer you cooperation.\nTogether we can kick the Americans out of Everon once and for all.","",rashiv
STRM_31v16,"What is this cooperation you speak of? Is it similar to the one we received seven years ago?","",astier
STRM_31v17,"That was unfortunate. Our commander at the time was a traitor and met his just end.\nWe are now returning to make things right for the island and finally return it to your hands.","",astier
STRM_31v18,"Lavish promises but we heard those before. Why should we trust you this time?","",astier
STRM_31v19,"You trusted me, Gaston. I thought we fought well side by side. Does that not make any difference?","",rashiv
STRM_31v20,"It does, Rashiv. It is the only reason we are talking. Explain this cooperation, please.","",astier
STRM_31v21,"There is bad blood between us, but is does not have to be.\nWe should try and let bygones be bygones. Presently, we have no quarrel with you. Actually, we even have a common enemy.\nWe can fight together and win together. Only then will Everon know peace.","",rashiv
STRM_31v22,"What happens to us when you win?","",astier
STRM_31v23,"We are authorized to grant you amnesty for any past crimes you may have done to the Soviet Union.\nYou will be allowed to stay on the island but will be prohibited from holding any position of power.\nYour goverment will be chosen from local people the only requirement beeing they were not part of any insurgents.","",rashiv
STRM_31v24,"We know the Americans seized most of your equipment. Once we secure the island we shall provide for you. We are going to give you helicopters, light tanks and boats. Free of charge, as a gift to the people of Everon.\nWe only ask that our air forces are clear to utilise your airport.","",rashiv
STRM_31v25,"That's what we get for our help? A communist puppet and some old scrap to drive around?\nI should not have expected anything else from the mighty Soviet Union.","",astier
STRM_31v26,"It is not the best deal you could have hoped for, true, but it is the only one available. I suggest you take it.","",rashiv
STRM_31v27,"You already betrayed us once before. What guarantees are there it won't happen again?","",astier
STRM_31v28,"None, only our word. But you keep asking the wrong questions.\nAstier, Poincare, Everonians, face the facts for once.","",rashiv
STRM_31v29,"You are few in number, barely holding out in this castle ruin. I share your vision of freedom and I admire your tenacity and willingness to fight.\nBut it is time to put out the veil from your eyes and see clearly.","",rashiv
STRM_31v30,"You are not going to win. We will return to Everon with a strong army and we will crush the Americans.\nThen if you are not with us, our command will want to wipe you out. And there's nothing we can do for you anymore.","",rashiv
STRM_31v31,"You either swallow your pride, bow your heads this one time - and ensure the survival of your island state.\nIt will not be the perfect dream that you all have but you will be alive and safe.","",rashiv
STRM_31v32,"That is the best that we can do for you. I am sorry, gaston, I wish I could do more.","",rashiv
STRM_31v33,"I understand, Rashiv. You are right. I do not want to see it - I refuse to see it - but it is perhaps time to stop resisting and embrace our fate.","",astier
STRM_31v34,"Many of our brothers lost their lives fighting for a good cause. It pains me not to avenge them. It pains me not to grant our children the home they deserve.","",astier
STRM_31v35,"But you are right. It is either a humilitiation or death for us. And with a good consience I cannot choose the latter.","",astier
STRM_31v36,"Here, Soviets, we gathered a lot of documents on the enemy - fortifications, bases, positions and defences - it could prove useful to your invasion plans.\nOnce you land we will help in your fight.\nI hope I do not live to regret this.","",astier
STRM_31v37,"This is a good decision, thank you, Gaston. I promise you, I will do my best to ensure we keep our end of the bargain. You have my word.","",rashiv
STRM_31v38,"I trust you, Rashiv. Pierre always praised you. It is in his memory that I accept this deal.","",astier
STRM_31v39,"What do you mean?","",rashiv
STRM_31v40,"Pierre is dead.","",astier
STRM_31v41,"Dead?","",rashiv
STRM_31v42,"We lose men every day. You were right, you know, this castle ruin is verything we have left.\nPierre actually wanted to rebuild the second tower after the war. Silly idea I thought, but now I regret we will never do it.","",astier
STRM_31v43,"what was that? Jean, check the patrols! Everybody get to your posts!","",astier
STRM_31v44,"You should go, Rashiv. Get these documents back to your command.","",astier

STRM_31r01,"THAT MUST BE OUR CONTACT OVER THERE, BY THE FIRE.","",lemontov
STRM_31r02,"GO BACK TO THE BOAT, SERGEI, AND GET THOSE DOCUMENTS TO KOLGUYEV. I'M GOING TO LEND THESE GUYS A HAND. OUT.","",lemontov
