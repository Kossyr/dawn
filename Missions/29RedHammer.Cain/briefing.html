<b>18th December 1988</b> - Day fifteen of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
Finally! At last, I am in command of my own platoon. And not only that, I am also in charge of the entire front! I have been truly blessed for such an honour to be granted to me!
<br><br>
I still remember our latest operation around Astrabirsk. We were dealing with heavy armour and the enemy sent in more tanks through a sideway. I still remember seeing the enemy tank come into view on our right. I was the only one who was seeing it. It aimed at comrade major Frolov, God bless his soul. I could have told the gunner to take aim, but he was still busy with the frontal assault. I let it play out. The shell hit comrade Frolov's tank and it blew up instantly. We dealt with the enemy afterwards.
<br><br>
Comrade Frolov somehow made it out of the burning vehicle only to die later in the hospital. How tragic. Someone has to step in and lead our forces forward, though. And my activity in the party and loyalty finally rewarded me, for I was promoted. 
<br><br>
Now that I am among the commanding officers, I have to shine much more than before. I have to make a name for myself. I have to aim higher. I hope I impress even the Army general himself and earn his appreciation.
<br><br>
My ambition is not yet soothed, it just got even bigger.

You have been given command of the northern front, comrade Major Kukushkin. Your objective is to break the enemy resistance and reconquer the northeastern part of the island.
<br><br>
On your signal, our forces will conduct an offensive across the front. You are leader of the operation and main thrust falls onto you. Don't forget you're also carrying our standard into battle.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">near the frontlines</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Continue to our <a href="marker:MeetingPoint">frontlines</a> and join our forces there. When all is set, give the signal for the northern front to advance.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Attack the enemy positions at the <a href="marker:Fortifications1">frontline</a>. Enemy positions are well fortified, expect heavy resistance. Be careful of the <a href="marker:Minefield">minefield</a>, provide cover for our engineers while they disable it once the situation is safe enough to do so.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Break through the <a href="marker:Fortifications1">frontlines</a>. Apart from the units of the <a href="marker:MeetingPoint">main offensive</a>, you will be supported by forces from the south.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Advance deeper into enemy territory by taking over the next <a href="marker:fortifications2">fortified position</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Attack and seize <a href="marker:Base">Arzapol</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_6"></a>An enemy counterattack is expected, most likely from the <a href="marker:Reinforcements">south</a>. Tank platoon <a href="marker:Tatyana">Tatyana</a> is ready to advance to help you in your defence, call them in whenever it suits you. Meet and destroy the coming reinforcements.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_7"></a>After a successful defence, advance to the western edge of the island through an enemy <a href="marker:Checkpoint">checkpoint</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_8"></a>Seize the last enemy position, the <a href="marker:Base2">Ob base</a>, and end the presence of the enemy in the north.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_9"></a>Once everything is secured, raise the flag over the <a href="marker:RaiseFlag">villa</a>.</p>

<p>Superb work, comrade Kukushkin. With this victory the enemy has lost Kolguyev for good. Our final push south will be a clean up work. You have done very well, comrade, and your abilities were noticed. Excellent work.</p>
