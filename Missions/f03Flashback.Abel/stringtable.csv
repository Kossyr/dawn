Livanokh and Lemontov discussions
Killing Rashiv's father
Livanokh villa


They cannot break the Russian bear. A total war is inevitable.
Ambition and iron will are going to determine the victor.
It is our turn to rewrite history.
Russian speaking, you say? That is bound to be an interesting story. Bring him to me.
We are not the bad guys here. It is a battle of different views of the world and you happen to find yourself in the middle of it.
Malden is falling, we are close, Sasha!
Not close enough! Push harder! Time is not on our side!
We lost because...
Because there are traitors in our ranks! Find them and weed them out! My plan can still work...
Where have you been last night? Where have you and Rashiv been?
I hate traitors, comrade Rashiv. Kill them all.
A trap will be sprung and the world will yet know of us, Grigory. Leave it to me.
It's over, Livanokh! I am taking you in.
I have not shown all my hand! Behold!
Stop it! No!

Hey, Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.


; year 1 1981

Cell -> Garrison -> Holding Cell -> Dyaconsen

First visit
Dyaconsen is the only visitor (allowed)
Lemontov does not speak much with anyone
Dyaconsen can't tell much about the outside world

Take a seat. Your visitor will be here shortly.


Hello, Grigory Lemontov.
It has been a while. How are you?
They told me you do not speak too much, but I did expect at least a simple 'Hello'.
I can only imagine how you are feeling. Belive me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.
This is not one would imagine the menace of the east - sitting silently, without motion, defeted. It seems you have given up.
Is this how you see the next fifteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.

Have you come to mock me?
Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.
I lost everything that was ever dear to me. I was forced to kill my own brother, betraying my comrades and my country. Because I believed it was for the right thing.
My reward is a fifteen year prison sentence, dictated by you, in solitude, far from home.
If you didn't do what you did, the other option was a death sentence.
I would rather be dead, frankly.
You don't mean that. You're full of anger, despair and hatred. Your guilt is dragging you down and it makes the world seem bleak.
You will get over it, I can promise you that. The pain will recede and you will heal - all in due time.
Speaking from experience?
We are from the same cloth, Grigory Lemontov. If anyone can understand you, it's only someone like you.
