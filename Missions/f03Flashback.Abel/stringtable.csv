Livanokh and Lemontov discussions
Killing Rashiv's father
Livanokh villa


They cannot break the Russian bear. A total war is inevitable.
Ambition and iron will are going to determine the victor.
It is our turn to rewrite history.
Russian speaking, you say? That is bound to be an interesting story. Bring him to me.
We are not the bad guys here. It is a battle of different views of the world and you happen to find yourself in the middle of it.
Malden is falling, we are close, Sasha!
Not close enough! Push harder! Time is not on our side!
We lost because...
Because there are traitors in our ranks! Find them and weed them out! My plan can still work...
Where have you been last night? Where have you and Rashiv been?
I hate traitors, comrade Rashiv. Kill them all.
A trap will be sprung and the world will yet know of us, Grigory. Leave it to me.
It's over, Livanokh! I am taking you in.
I have not shown all my hand! Behold!
Stop it! No!

Hey, Lemontov, you have a visitor.
Yeah, I didn't believe it either. I'm going to take you to the visiting booth, follow me.

Cell -> Garrison -> Holding Cell -> Dyaconsen

First visit
Dyaconsen is the only visitor (allowed)
Lemontov does not speak much with anyone
Dyaconsen can't tell much about the outside world

Hello, Grigory Lemontov.
It has been a while. How are you?
They told you do not speak too much, but I did expect at least a simple 'Hello'.
I can only imagine how you are feeling. Belive me, I know it's difficult. Not sure how I would cope with it myself.
But you should know it's better to talk about these things. It is of little use to keep all your feelings hidden inside for yourself.
Their weight will keep dragging you down. You might get into the darkest places of your mind and that's not a plce you want to spend the rest of your live in.
If you don't want to talk to the doctors, fine, but you should talk to someone. Anyone really.
Is this how you imagine the next fifteen years? Held up in that small cell looking at the wall? Doesn't seem overly productive to me.

Have you come to mock me?
Not at all. I thought you would appreciate the company.
I don't
