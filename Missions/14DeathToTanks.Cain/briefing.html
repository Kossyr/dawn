   <b>30.11.1986</b> - They came. I've known since Everon they would come and they finally came. In strength. They kicked us out of the southern sector in less than two hours. True, are casualties could have been higher, but all our preparations were meaningless - the enemy just swept through. 
   <br><br>
   Our next line of defence is way up north and the next <a href="marker:Base">base</a> in their path is weakly defended and will not withhold any major attack. Lemontov came to me in the morning and told me I'm going with him on a mission. We are to set up an ambush and destroy the incoming attack before it can reach our base. Before the enmy mounts a second wave, our troops will be long gone up north. That is the plan anyway.
   <br><br>
   Few men agains a tank platoon. I did not think I'd live to see the day.

	One is never bored with Lemontov it seems.

    Rashiv, there is a <a href="marker:Tanks">tank column</a> that left the enemy territory this morning and is heading for our <a href="marker:Base">base</a>. Our position is weak and we have to pull back but for that we require time. We must ensure the tanks do not reach our base so that our troops can safely retreat north.
<br><br>
    You did well in Lamentin and I hope you will try even harder this time.
<br><br>
    The plan is to set up an <a href="marker:Ambush">ambush</a> along the road. We already hid few <a href="marker:Crate">anti-tank missiles</a> there and we also have few mines at our disposal. Try not to miss for you won't have a second chance.
<br><br>
    We start at our <a href="marker:start">base</a>.

    <p>Good work, Rashiv. We delayed the enemy a great deal and saved a lot of men in the process. You keep exceeding my expectations, Rashiv!</p>
