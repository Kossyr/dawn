   <b>28.11.1986</b> - It's been three weeks since Everon. We have fortified Kolguyev and are waiting for the enemy attack which will surely come.
   <br><br>
   I told what I've learned to captain Shaposhnikov and he shared my doubts though even he didn't know who came up with that rebel story - who is behind our attack on Everon. The one responsible for this whole mess. I'll give him time, but I fear it's someone very much high up - and digging into it could cost me my life.
   <br><br>
   The last few days were spent mostly on patrol, day and night. The attack still has not come, but we all know it's close. It is only a matter of time.
   <br><br>
   I had a lot of time to think. The people on Everon are valiant and they desire peace, although they had to go to war to achieve it. I feel like I went through a purgatory on that island. I feel somehow different. I am no longer a shy boy lurking in the shadows, fearful of old memories haunting him.
   <br><br>
   I see a new path ahead of me. An old chapter is closed and a fresh one is beginning. I embrace it.
