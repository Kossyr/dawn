STRM_12v01,"Are you certain, comrade Rashiv?",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v02,"Yes, comrade Shaposhnikov, more than certain. Their intention is to pursue us to Kolguyev.",rashiv
STRM_12v03,"At least we are now sure that an attack is coming, but the problem is we are far from ready to fight them off.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v04,"We are understaffed, underequipped and right now seriously lacking any morale. Difficult times are ahead of us.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v05,"I thank you for the information, comrade. And the way you managed to evade capture and escape from Everon is truly remarkable.\nI think you deserve a promotion at the very least, comrade corporal!",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v06,"Thank you, comrade Shaposhnikov!",rashiv
STRM_12v07,"I'll bring this up with my superiors. As for you, I welcome you to my squad. Comrade Yashin will show you around tomorrow.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v08,"For now, you should go get some rest. You deserve it.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v09,"Comrade Shaposhnikov, there is one thing I wanted to bring up...",rashiv
STRM_12v10,"What is it, comrade Rashiv?",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v11,"Well, the rebels, they... they made it clear they did not ask for our help and did not see me as a liberator but as an invader.\nThey claimed we betrayed them once before.",rashiv
STRM_12v12,"Comrade Shaposhnikov, what did they mean?",rashiv
STRM_12v13,"Hm... it's not exactly a public knowledge but it's not a well guarded secret either.\nSince you are involved already, I think I should tell you.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v14,"You do know we took over Everon eight years ago. It was during the island's rebellion against the Americans.\nWhen we arrived, we destroyed the rebellion alongside the American forces.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v15,"Many people died, the rest was rounded up. The ones you met might have been veterans of the war. They are not the kind to forget.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v16,"That means our attack on Everon was based on a lie?",rashiv
STRM_12v17,"More like a half-truth, but yes. Be advised and do not dig into this too deeply.\nIt stinks of politics and forces far beyond your grasp.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v18,"My comrades died, comrade Shaposhnikov, they died while fighting for this half-truth. Did they put down their lives for nothing?",rashiv
STRM_12v19,"I understand, comrade Rashiv, but Everon is not our immediate concern at the moment.\nWe have a much bigger problem on our hands here on Kolguyev.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v20,"I can promise you this discussion is not over. Whoever is responsible for this mess will have to answer.\nBut for now, we have to hold our positions here if we ever hope to return to Everon.",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v21,"I understand. Thank you, comrade Shaposhnikov.",rashiv
STRM_12v22,"Now, get some rest. You'll need all your strength soon.",shaposhnikov

STRM_12v23,"Rise and shine, Sergey! It's time for your night shift.\nFollow me! I'll give you a ride!",yashin
STRM_12v24,"What a lovely night...",rashiv
STRM_12v25,"It's so dark I can't even see your car.",rashiv
STRM_12v26,"Hold on, I'll turn the lights on!",yashin

STRM_12v27,"Slept well?",yashin
STRM_12v28,"Hardly. Kept waking up.",rashiv
STRM_12v29,"Nightmares?",yashin
STRM_12v30,"More like uneasiness.",rashiv
STRM_12v31,"Yeah, I got you. The island is shrouded in a general sense of nervous anticipation and a chilling fear of coming attack.",yashin
STRM_12v32,"Right. That must be it.",rashiv
STRM_12v33,"It's been three weeks since Everon, right? How are you holding up?",yashin
STRM_12v34,"Quite well given the circumstances. I haven't really grown too close to anyone in my old squad.",rashiv
STRM_12v35,"There was comrade Dostoevsky, the lieutenant. A good leader and a teacher.\nOthers, I don't really remember their names just their bodies strewn across the road.",rashiv
STRM_12v36,"I remember this friendly guy, Morokov. Very easy going, seemed like a nice guy. That did not stop the bullets though.",rashiv
STRM_12v37,"Not a good recipe for dreams, I see. It's incredible you've got through all that.",yashin
STRM_12v38,"The rebels helped me a great deal. I would not be here without them. Too bad I have no way of repaying them.",rashiv
STRM_12v39,"You came back to tell the tale. That's the best you can do at the moment.",yashin
STRM_12v40,"Let's forget Everon for a while.",rashiv
STRM_12v41,"You're right. You should concern yourself with the shilka you're going to be guarding.",yashin
STRM_12v42,"As if that demands anything.",rashiv
STRM_12v43,"Not falling asleep. Also, we should have the eastern shoreline together tomorrow.",yashin
STRM_12v44,"I can't wait.",rashiv

STRM_12v45,"Finally, a relief. I almost fell asleep an hour ago.",relief
STRM_12v46,"You'll get your sleep soon. Anything out of the ordinary?",yashin
STRM_12v47,"Nah, so far so good. Although the patrols were doubled for this shift. There was some radio disturbance earlier in the night.",relief
STRM_12v48,"Where is my partner if they were doubled?",rashiv
STRM_12v49,"Sorry, it includes only the bases and the shoreline. Lack of men.\nIt's going to be only you and the shilka.",relief
STRM_12v50,"It's probably just a false alarm anyway. Like that one a week ago.",yashin
STRM_12v51,"Possibly but keep your eyes peeled. It was targeting the southern sector.",relief
STRM_12v52,"Right, let's go then. Hop in the car and I'll take you to your base.",yashin
STRM_12v53,"Here, take these night vision goggles and enjoy your shift.",relief

STRM_12v54,"Here we are! Let's go!",yashin

STRM_12v55,"What the hell? American special forces? Shit, they're going after the shilka!",rashiv
