STRM_12v01,"Are you certain, comrade Rashiv?","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v02,"Yes comrade captain, more than certain. Their intention is to pursue us to Kolguyev.","",rashiv
STRM_12v03,"At least we are now sure that an attack is coming, but the problem is we are far from ready to fight them off.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v04,"We are understaffed, underequipped and right now seriously lacking any morale. If they come tomorrow we won't hold for a week.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v05,"I thank you for the information, comrade. And the way you managed to evade capture and escape from Everon is truly remarkable.\nI think you deserve a promotion at the very least, comrade corporal!","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v06,"Thank you, comrade captain!","",rashiv
STRM_12v07,"I'll bring this up with my superiors. You go catch some breath. You deserve it.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v08,"Comrade captain, there is one thing I wanted to bring up...","",rashiv
STRM_12v09,"The rebels, they... they made it pretty clear they did not ask for our help and did not see me as a liberator but as an invader.\nThat is the exact opposite of what we were actually told.","",rashiv
STRM_12v10,"I can't say much about this, comrade, but you are a bright fellow and can put the pieces together.\nKnow that I am aware of this.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v11,"The order to attack must have come from way above. I wouldn't mention it further if I were you.\nIt would be better if we have never talked about it but.. I can promise I will look into it.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v12,"Thank you comrade captain. I am simply concerned...","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v13,"I know, soldier, but we cannot do much about this right now. We have a much bigger problem on our hands that we must see to.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_12v14,"I like you, comrade Rashiv. Next time we speak, I'll hopefully tell you more.\nFor now, dismissed!","",shaposhnikov

STRM_12v15,"Rise and shine, Sergei! It's time for your night shift.\nFollow me! I'll give you a ride!","",yashin
STRM_12v16,"What a lovely alarm clock...","",rashiv
STRM_12v17,"It's so dark I can't even see your car.","",rashiv
STRM_12v18,"Hold on, I'll turn the lights on!","",yashin

STRM_12v19,"Slept well?","",yashin
STRM_12v20,"Hardly. Kept waking up.","",rashiv
STRM_12v21,"Yeah, I got you. The island is shrouded in a general sense of nervous anticipation and a chilling fear of incoming attack.","",yashin
STRM_12v22,"Couldn't have said better myself, Vadim. But it is freezing!","",rashiv
STRM_12v23,"You'll get warmer by the fire. It must be below zero at this point, although there is still no snow.\nI guess we won't get snowy Christmas for another year.","",yashin
STRM_12v24,"If we even get there, Vadim. How's the situation at home, any news?","",rashiv
STRM_12v25,"Still nothing official. There are rumoured reinforcements, but if they were sent they would be here long ago.\nKreml doesn't seem to be able to agree on anything so they pretty much left us to our own devices...","",yashin
STRM_12v26,"I'm surprised the international community didn't do anything. Or does no one care?","",rashiv
STRM_12v27,"Care for what?\nFew communists getting wrecked by NATO on godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere?\nI'd be surprised if this was even in the news.","",yashin
STRM_12v28,"Similar thing happened here seven years ago, and that caught their attention.","",rashiv
STRM_12v29,"Yeah because Livanoch had a nuclear arsenal at his disposal. We would be glad for T80s at this point.","",yashin

STRM_12v30,"Finally, a relief. I was bored out of my mind I tell you! Almost fell asleep an hour ago.","",relief
STRM_12v31,"You'll get your sleep soon. Anything out of the ordinary?","",yashin
STRM_12v32,"Nah, so far so good. Although the patrols were doubled for this shift. There was some radio disturbance earlier in the night.","",relief
STRM_12v33,"Where is my partner if they were doubled?","",rashiv
STRM_12v34,"Sorry, it includes only bases and the shoreline. Lack of men.\nIt's going to be only you and the shilka.","",relief
STRM_12v35,"It's probably just a false alarm anyway. Like that one a week ago.","",yashin
STRM_12v36,"Possibly but keep your eyes peeled. It was targeting the southern sector.","",relief
STRM_12v37,"Right, let's go then. Hop in the car and I'll take you to your base.","",yashin
STRM_12v38,"Here, take these night visions and enjoy your shift.","",relief

STRM_12v39,"Here we are! Let's relief that guy!","",yashin
