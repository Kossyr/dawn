<b>10th February 1989</b> - I miss my father.
<br><br>
He always knew what to do. He was always so sure of everything, he never doubted the path he chose and he always stuck to his word. I always wanted to be like him and follow in his footsteps, especially after his death. His loss devastated me - I lost my only family, my only pillar in life that I could always rely on - in its place, there now was a gaping hole full of sadness and despair.
<br><br>
I joined the army, possibly hoping to become what he was - thinking it would bring me solace. Army life did not awaken me inside though, if anything, I became even more isolated and closed off. Being trained at the same base he served as a commander and being liken to him by officers kept reminding me of him and the loss that his death meant to me. I drifted through my days without a proper purpose or reason.
<br><br>
It all changed with Everon. War put all my trainings to test and I shone like a beacon in my squad of low ranking comrades - my father's blood kicked in and I felt like doing something meaningful for the first time in years. And then I met Lemontov.
<br><br>
The legend, the myth, Grigory Lemontov knew my father and he knew me - for he chose me for a nighttime mission out of all the available, perhaps more qualified, soldiers. It was the moment I needed - I slowly got out of my dark places and was able to finally think with a clear head. Thoughts of my father still drove me, but this time I felt I had a purpose - find the truth behind my father's death.
<br><br>
Me and Lemontov worked together on Kolguyev. I felt he kept me close to him as if keeping an eye on me. Was it because he knew my father? Was he taking care of the son of his old friend? No matter his reasoning, I enjoyed his presence, his advice and his guidance. I learned a lot from him and I finally felt like that gaping hole in my heart got smaller. Lemontov became the father figure I was so desperately missing.
<br><br>
Alas, it did not last. I felt we were close enough that he would tell me about my father's death - yet he evaded the question and didn't answer. Why? I need to know what truly transpired in those dark days. Why can't he tell me? What could he possibly be hiding? Covering someone or something? Is the truth dangerous? Did my father learn something that he shouldn't have? Is Lemontov protecting me or someone else?
<br><br>
So many questions and no answers. I still followed Lemontov, believing him that Volkov needed to be stopped - but after what transpired... Gaston, Jean, Pierre and all the others... butchered like animals, shot in the back in the moment of their greatness weakness, execution style... I still can't get over the repugnant act. I thought it was a ruse, a trick - that Lemontov found a way to appease Volkov's minions and not become a despicable murderer. He avoided me though and I only saw him at Volkov's speech alongside the others - he didn't  acknowledge my presence even though he must have seen me. Was it his guilt that prevented him from even looking at me?
<br><br>
He hides the truth about my father. He hides himself from me and clearly does not require my company any longer. I guess I was just one of his tools in order to win on Kolguyev and get him into the commanding tent of Volkov.
<br><br>
So be it, Lemontov, I was hoping you were different. You wished to wait for Malden, sacrificng the people of Everon in the process. Show me it has been worth it. Show me their sacrifice will bring us victory. Show me this does not end in a world-ending disaster.
<br><br>
Show me I was right to believe in you.

Rejoice, comrade, for the final victory is near!
<br><br>
We are invading Malden. After our spetsnaz softened their defences and our jets destroyed their armoured vehicles, it is time for the infantry to secure the southern part of the island, concluding the first step along our way to win this war.
<br><br>
You command the eastern paratrooper groups and your target is <a href="marker:Chapoi">Chapoi</a>. All the details are in the objectives' description.
<br><br>
There has been a development - one of our jets crashed <a href="CrashSite">in the middle</a> of the enemy territory. Your <a href="marker:Leonid">drop point</a> is closest - take a detour and make haste to locate the crash site and find the pilot before the enemy does. Return to the mission afterwards.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">in the air</a> with the rest of our invasion forces approaching Malden. Good luck!

<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Helicopters will take you over to the <a href="marker:DropZoneEast">drop zone east</a> where you will paradrop. Groups under the command of <a href="marker:Anton">Anton</a> are paradropping in the <a href="marker:DropZoneWest">drop zone west</a>. They have their own mission objective with Anton itself assigned to protect your west flank. You are supported by groups <a href="marker:LeonidBlack">Leonid Black</a> who will help you in your attack on <a href="marker:Chapoi">Chapoi</a>, <a href="marker:LeonidRed">Leonid Red</a> who supports the eastern landings and <a href="marker:LeonidGreen">Leonid Green</a> who supports the attack on <a href="marker:LePort">Le Port</a>. The latter two groups also guard the roads to prevent reinforcements from reaching <a href="marker:Chapoi">Chapoi</a>.</p>
