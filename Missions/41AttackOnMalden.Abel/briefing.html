Rejoice, comrade, for the final victory is near!
<br><br>
We are invading Malden. After our spetsnaz softened their defences and our jets destroyed their armoured vehicles, it is time for the infantry to secure the southern part of the island, concluding the first step in our way to win this war.
<br><br>
You command the eastern paratrooper groups and your target is <a href="marker:Chapoi">Chapoi</a>. All the details are in the objectives' description.
<br><br>
There has been a development - one of our jets crashed <a href="CrashSite">in the middle</a> of the enemy territory. Your <a href="marker:Leonid">drop point</a> is closest - take a detour and make haste to locate the crash site and find the pilot before the enemy does. Return to the mission afterwards.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:Start">in the air</a> with the rest of our invasion forces approaching Malden. Good luck!
