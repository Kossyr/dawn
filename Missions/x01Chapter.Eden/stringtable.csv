STRM_x01v02,"You won then. You have me. But listen to me before you do something rash.","",Daladier
STRM_x01v03,"We both want the very same thing - free Everon. We just have different ways of achieving that.\nI believe that without the help of the West, the East will come and enslave us. We can't let that happen.","",Daladier
STRM_x01v04,"You know they're coming. You survived their first onslaught. Should have I entrusted the island's defence to your hands?\nMaybe. Would have we survived? I doubt it. We need the American protection to keep our people away from the Soviet yoke.","",Daladier
STRM_x01v05,"I might have gone about things rapidly and perhaps too rashly.\nBut we had to act fast before another war was upon us and this time we would not survive it.\nEven the last time was a miracle. And I do not wish to see Everon turned into a bloody battlefield again.","",Daladier
STRM_x01v06,"What say you?","",Daladier
STRM_x01v07,"I say I have no words for traitors. Goodbye, Daladier.","",Astier

STRM_x01v08,"Everon and its people are free. We shall fight anyone who disputes that be it an American or a Soviet.","",Astier
STRM_x01v09,"This is our home and if it is blood that is required to keep it then we shall shed it. But we won't be the only ones bleeding.","",Astier
STRM_x01v10,"No foreign masters and their occupant armies. A truly free Everon. That is what we deserve and that is what we shall fight for.","",Astier
STRM_x01v11,"No matter how long it is going to take we will be free once more.","",Astier

STRM_x01v12,"Comrades! As you might already heard, we are going to war!","",dostoevsky
STRM_x01v13,"The US Military once again invaded the island of Everon. Locals rose up in arms and the island is in the middle of a civil war.\nAs the nearest units of the Soviet Army we are tasked with invading Everon and restoring the local government back to power.","",dostoevsky
STRM_x01v14,"But comrade Dostoevsky, a direct assault on American troops can have serious international consequences.\nNot to mention we are not many, shouldn't we wait for reinforcements?\nIs this like seven years ago when ...","",morokov
STRM_x01v15,"I appreciate your concerns, comrade Morokov, but they are wrong.\nWe were asked for help by the rebel forces and thus have to answer their call to arms.\nThe Soviet Army will not let good people die at the hands of capitalist dogs while we are able to do something about it.","",dostoevsky
STRM_x01v16,"Command already made the decision.\nThe attack is starting in an hour. The choppers are waiting to take us to the island.\nAll information is in briefings. Get ready comrades. For Rodina!","",dostoevsky
