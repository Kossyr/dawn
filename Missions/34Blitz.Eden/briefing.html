<b>26th January 1989</b> - Day thirty-nine of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
The last month was a bit uneventful - we were mostly waiting around on Kolguyev while the invasion was being prepared. It took a while to get all the troops, vehicles and equipment ready. But we are finally here. Back on Everon.
<br><br>
The infantry took most of the northern part of the island including the airport. We arrived during the night and now are being sent into battle. I can't wait.
<br><br>
Our goal is Montignac, the capital city. I am in charge of the tank platoon that shall take this city. My tank will be the first to enter it. After all the hardships and battles, I alone am to liberate Montignac from the enemy! We failed to take it during the first invasion. It almost cost us the war. Now it shall win us another!
<br><br>
Comrade Zubarev is watching me intensely. I'll show him true skill. I shall become invaluable to comrade Zubarev, comrade Volkov, the Red Army... I'll attain the highest military ranks, get my own army perhaps? It is only a small step to Kremlin from there!
<br><br>
The future certainly looks bright, does it not?

Our invasion forces successfully captured the airport and the city of Saint Phillippe. We have been waiting for the arrival of heavy tanks to continue the push south. Your tanks, comrade Kukushkin!
<br><br>
Your first task is to get to <a href="marker:SaintPhillippe">Saint Phillippe</a> and help repel an enemy attack we are expecting at any moment. Afterwards, you are to seize the villages of <a href="marker:Meaux">Meaux</a> and <a href="marker:Tyrone">Tyrone</a>.
<br><br>
Once secured, head further south. Beware the <a href="marker:Fortifications">main road</a> as the enemy fortified it and is expecting your attack here. You can use some other way to bypass their forts and get through the neck. We leave that choice to you.
<br><br>
Your final goal is the capital city of Everon, <a href="marker:Montignac">Montignac</a>. Shatter the enemy forces and claim the city. 
<br><br>
You start at the <a href="marker:Start">airport</a>.
