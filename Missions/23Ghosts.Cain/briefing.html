   <b>12.12.1986</b> - Stas Shaposhnikov was the first countryman I met after the imprisonment. He was the one responsible for the prisoner exchange and he personally welcomed me back to the USSR. I haven't known him by then - he wasn't under Livanoch back in the day. He was polite enough, although as I knew nothing about him I didn't tell him much.
   <br><br>
   I spent the next month in Leningrad. More specifically, at the outskirts of the city getting back into shape with some other boys from Spetsnaz. I wasn't slacking in the prison, but I needed more exercise as well as simply holding a gun again. It was a good month. I spoke with Stas more frequently. There were a lot of things we agreed on. Especially regarding the need for change.
   <br><br>
   The Soviet Union was in a spiral leading to its downfall. Our economy could not keep up with the West. It was a matter of time before we would become irrelevant. There were two options for the future - let it all fall and try to rebuild or strike one hard time at the enemy to break them. Prolonged war was not an option - we would lose. But using nuclear arsenal the enemy could be wiped out before any serious defence is mounted. Killing billions in order to save face and a dying state. This was a despicable act and nobody ever dared to pursue it.Nobody - except for one person.
   <br><br>
   I got back into shape in Leningrad and grew closer to Stas, who shared my thoughts and agreed with them. After a month, Vladimir Volkov came to see me. It was an interesting meeting. It could have ended either way, I wasn't quite sure if they knew what happened with me and Livanoch. But Volkov was amicable and after a brief exchange, he took me back to the army and made me a high Spetsnaz operative again - although he did not restore me to my previous rank of colonel. I've heard about him from before but seeing him I realized he was very dangerous, perhaps even more than I gave him credit for before. He was very much like Livanoch, ruthless, cunning and desicive. He was a man willing to act upon Livanoch's plan to save the USSR and doom all others.

	It is time we take the fight to the enemy. Our first offensive shall reclaim the central Kolguyev. You are the vanguard, comrade.
	<br><br>
	We'll take advantage of the heavy mist this morning and weaken the enemy before the main assault starts in an hour's time. The goal is to create as much chaos and distraction in the enemy rear as possible.
	<br><br>
	The primary target is <a href="marker:MainBase">this base</a>. We have intel of an <a href="marker:Ammo">ammo depot</a>, <a href="marker:FuelStation">fuel station</a> and <a href="marker:Tanks">tanks</a>. Destroy as much as you can. A small Spetsnaz team is waiting <a href="marker:SpetsNaz">nearby</a> and will join you if you wish. As secondary objectives you can go after <a href="marker:Trucks">supply trucks</a> and <a href="marker:Choppers">helicopters</a>, but this is not critical to the success of the mission. Avoid fortified checkpoints at <a href="marker:Checkpoint1">Fa51</a>, <a href="marker:Checkpoint2">Fd53</a> and <a href="marker:Checkpoint3">Ef55</a> and the base to the <a href="marker:Base">north</a>. Maintain radio silence throughout the mission.
	<br><br>
	You start hidden in the mist at the <a href="marker:Start">edge of a forest</a> in the enemy territory.
