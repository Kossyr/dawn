   <b>12.12.1986</b> - Stas Shaposhnikov was the first countryman I met after the imprisonment. He was the one responsible for the prisoner exchange and he personally welcomed me back to USSR. I dind't know him by then - he wasn't under Livanoch back in the day. He was polite enough, although as I knew nothing about him I didn't tell him much.
   <br><br>
   I spent the next month in Leningrad. More specifically, at the outskirts of the city getting back into shape with some other boys from Spetsnaz. I wasn't slacking in the prison, but I needed more exercise as well as holding a gun again. It was a good month. I spoke with Stas more frequently. There were a lot of things we agreed on. Especially regarding the need for change. For something new. Out with the old, in with the new? But it was only talk at the time.
   <br><br>
   Vladimir Volkov came to see me after a month. It was an interesting meeting. It could have ended either way, I wasn't quite sure if they knew what happened with me and Livanoch. But Volkov was amicable and after a brief exchange, he took me back to the army and made me a high Spetsnaz operative again - although he did not restore mi to my previous rank. I've heard about him from before but seeing him I realized he was very dangerous, perhaps even more than I gave him credit for before. He was very much like Livanoch, although he lacked his military genius. But he knew the old plan and was willing to act upon it.
   <br><br>
   Although it looks differently right now. Livanoch used Everon as a staging ground for an attack on Malden. Malden was the main prize and we almost had it. Volkov sent a token force on Everon and our army got its ass kicked. And now we almost lost Kolguyev and just now are barely able to mount an offensive. Interesting strategy, or did something backfire? Or is there something I do not see? Why not attack directly at the Americans, maybe even hit Malden? Does he need NATO to commit first? By attacking Kolguyev they attacked the Soviet soil first, it gives him the right of defence.
   <br><br>
   The reinforcements arrived, but nuclear weapons are not among them. If he is following Livanoch plan it does not make sense. I have to keep both my eyes peeled and both ears to the ground. I must know what his plan is before he has time to realize it.

	It is time we take the fight to the enemy. Our first offensive shall reclaim the central Kolguyev. You are the vanguard, comrade.
	<br><br>
	We'll take advantage of the heavy mist this morning and weaken the enemy before the main assault starts in an hour's time. The goal is to create as much chaos and distraction in the enemy rear as possible. 
	<br><br>
	The main target is <a href="marker:MainBase">this base</a>. We have intel of an <a href="marker:Ammo">ammo depot</a>, <a href="marker:FuelStation">fuel station</a> and <a href="marker:Tanks">tanks</a>. Destroy as much as you can. A small Spetsnaz team is waiting <a href="marker:SpetsNaz">nearby</a> and will join you if you wish. As secondary objectives you can go after <a href="marker:Trucks">supply trucks</a> and <a href="marker:Choppers">choppers</a>, but this is not critical to the success of the mission. Avoid fortified checkpoints at <a href="marker:Checkpoint1">Fa51</a>, <a href="marker:Checkpoint2">Fd53</a> and <a href="marker:Checkpoint3">Ef55</a> and the base to the <a href="marker:Base">north</a>. Maintain radio silence throughout the mission.
	<br><br>
	You start hidden in the mist at the <a href="marker:Start">edge of a forest</a> in the enemy territory.
