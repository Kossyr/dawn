<b>12th December 1988</b> - Stas Shaposhnikov was the first countryman I met after the imprisonment. He was the one responsible for the prisoner exchange and he personally welcomed me back to the USSR. He used to serve under Rashiv and he knew my secret. i was lucky, for in case of anybody else, I might have been shot the moment I arrived, but instead I found an ally.
<br><br>
I spent the next month getting back into shape with some other boys from spetsnaz. I wasn't slacking in the prison, but I needed more exercise as well as simply holding a gun again. Kaplinsky became my second-in-command of sorts. We were no friends, but I tolerated his presence. The rest of the spetsnaz were silent types and they obeyed without a question. We got along and that was everything I could have asked for.
<br><br>
I talked with Stas on occasion, when the time allowed. He was the only one I could depend on. I was sure he was not working for Volkov - he was, after all, Rashiv's man. We slowly hitched a plan going foward - I would get closer to Volkov so that when the time was right, I would be able to strike. Stas threw out his nets to find ot who was likely to be Volkov's supporter and spy, and on the other hand who would listen to us and stay loyal to the country rather than one man.
<br><br>
It was much harder than I anticipated - it seemed mostly that the army was stuffed with men loyal to Volkov. The situation at home didn't help - a lot of infighting, corruption, seceding states - the Soviet Union was closing in on its downfall. In times of political instability, it was the perfect moment to continue where Livanokh left off.
<br><br>
The days flew by quickly, until one day we received a mission assignment.
<br><br>
I expected a sneaky attack on Everon than what we actually received - Afghanistan. I did think one of Volkov's strategy could be to get me out of the way for the time being - so I could not interfere in any of his plans. He did not trust me yet, I would have to gain that trust. I could not really object, so I went. From one end of the world to the other. So far, I've only heard stories about the place - now I got to experience it first-hand.

<p><a name="Plan"></a>
It is time we take the fight to the enemy. Our first offensive shall reclaim the central Kolguyev. You are the vanguard, comrade.
<br><br>
We'll take advantage of the heavy mist this morning and weaken the enemy before the main assault starts in an hour's time. The goal is to create as much chaos and distraction in the enemy rear as possible.
<br><br>
The primary target is <a href="marker:MainBase">the Irtysh base</a>. We have intel of an <a href="marker:Ammo">ammo depot</a>, <a href="marker:FuelStation">fuel station</a> and <a href="marker:Tanks">tanks</a>. Destroy as much as you can. A small spetsnaz team is waiting <a href="marker:SpetsNaz">nearby</a> and will join you if you wish. As secondary objectives you can go after <a href="marker:Trucks">supply trucks</a> in Astrabirsk and <a href="marker:Choppers">helicopters</a> in the Yenisei base, but this is not critical to the success of the mission. Avoid fortified checkpoints at <a href="marker:Checkpoint1">Fa51</a>, <a href="marker:Checkpoint2">Fd53</a> and <a href="marker:Checkpoint3">Ef55</a> and the <a href="marker:Base">Dnieper base</a>. Maintain radio silence throughout the mission.
<br><br>
You start hidden in the mist at the <a href="marker:Start">edge of a forest</a> in the enemy territory.
