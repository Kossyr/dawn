STRM_23v01,"Thank you both for coming. We have matters to discuss.",Lemontov
STRM_23v02,"Whenever we meet like this, just the three of us, there are no comrades or ranks.\nTo you I'm just Grigory.",Lemontov
STRM_23v03,"Stas, at your service.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v04,"Sergey. It's nice to be able to finally talk openly.",Rashiv
STRM_23v05,"Back to business. Our successful defence means we are on the offensive and victory on Kolguyev is but a matter of time.\nWe must start to look into the future.",Lemontov
STRM_23v06,"Which is not as bright as it might look. I'll go straight to the point, Sergey - we would like you to join us.",Lemontov
STRM_23v07,"Join you in what?",Rashiv
STRM_23v08,"Stas, give him the grand tour.",Lemontov
STRM_23v09,"Eight years ago, a rogue general Alexander Livanokh declared war on the Unites States and attacked Everon and subsequently Malden.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v10,"It was a bloody conflict which we lost after a long and hard battle.\nThe peace treaty let us hold onto Kolguyev but keep its garrison to a minimum. We also lost Everon.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v11,"I am aware of that.",Rashiv
STRM_23v12,"Back to the present then. The current leader of the Kolguyev contingent is Vladimir Volkov.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v13,"His name might not tell you much, but he is a veteran of the first war.\nAlthough previously of low rank, he rose to his current position during the inter-war years.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v14,"We believe his quick rise is no coincidence, nor his assignment on Kolguyev.\nThere might be a certain goal he and others that help him wish to achieve.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v15,"Sounds like... a conspiracy.",Rashiv
STRM_23v16,"It very well might be. He served as an officer in Livanokh's army.\nHe might want to finish what Livanokh started eight years ago.",Lemontov
STRM_23v17,"Which is?",Rashiv
STRM_23v18,"War with the West. War with NATO and the United States.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v19,"You mean a world war.",Rashiv
STRM_23v20,"Essentially. And you know that the next big conflict between two superpowers will be nuclear.\nIt will be the end of the world as we know it, if not the end of the world period. ",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v21,"And you believe this Volkov wishes to achieve that? That's madness.",Rashiv
STRM_23v22,"We don't have any proof of course. At this point you could say it's just a theory. But there are signs.",Lemontov
STRM_23v23,"Look at the connections between the first war, Livanokh and Volkov.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v24,"Then there is the botched attack on Everon,\nprovoking the Americans into an open conflict which can easily escalate into a full blown war.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v25,"We don't know what will happen after we win on Kolguyev, but who says Volkov will stop at that?\nThat he won't push the enemy all the way back to Malden?",Lemontov
STRM_23v26,"So, what do you intend to do?",Rashiv
STRM_23v27,"At the moment, we are gathering information. We keep our eyes open, ears to the ground.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v28,"We must know what Volkov's plan is before we can stop it. Right now we are still blind.",Lemontov
STRM_23v29,"We're not asking you for much, Sergey,\njust be careful what you hear and what you're told and keep in mind that something like this is afoot.",Lemontov
STRM_23v30,"I agree, of course. Have you tried informing the Kremlin?",Rashiv
STRM_23v31,"Nothing indicates that he does not follow their orders.\nThe defence of Kolguyev is within our country's interest.",Lemontov
STRM_23v32,"They could have also sancioned a limited attack on Everon. Just to test the waters.",Lemontov
STRM_23v33,"Volkov's next steps is what we need to be watchful of.",Lemontov
STRM_23v34,"I understand that him going rogue would make us all traitors...\nAnd starting a world-ending war in addition to that is insane...",Rashiv
STRM_23v35,"I'll help you in any way I can.",Rashiv
STRM_23v36,"Good. This is what we wanted to hear. We'll keep in touch, Sergey.",Lemontov
STRM_23v37,"Welcome to the club.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_23v38,"It goes without saying, but don't tell anyone what we discussed here and don't meet publicly any more than necessary.\nTechnically going against Volkov would be considered treason before we have any proof of his wrongdoings.",Lemontov
STRM_23v39,"Stay safe until our next meeting.",Lemontov


STRM_23v40,"Come on lads, enough lollygagging. Time to earn your pay.",lemontov
STRM_23v41,"Comrade major, we follow you. In case you need any more charges, we have some in those crates.",kaplinsky
