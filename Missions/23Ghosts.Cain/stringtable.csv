STRM_23v01,"Thank you for coming. We have matters to discuss.","",lemontov
STRM_23v02,"First of all, good work with the defence yesterday. With our victory and incoming reinforcements we can finally go on the offensive.","",lemontov
STRM_23v03,"But there are far more troubling issues.\NStas told me about your adventures on Everon, Sergei. And about the rebels there.","",lemontov
STRM_23v04,"It's like a bad repeating dream because we did the same thing seven years ago.\nThe war on Everon was fabricated, beyond doubt. Both of them in fact.\nIt seems Zubarev wanted to provoke NATO into an open conflict. Maybe even to get them on Kolguyev.","",lemontov
STRM_23v05,"But why would he do that?","",rashiv
STRM_23v06,"In his case it's quite easy why. Whatever he does it's always on the orders of Volkov.","",staposhnikov
STRM_23v07,"He attacked Everon on the orders of Vladimir Volkov... the Army General?","",rashiv
STRM_23v08,"None other. Experienced politician and respectable military commander.\nSmart, ambitious and ruthless. A very dangerous man.","",lemontov
STRM_23v09,"If he's fabricating claims for war and provoking the enemy, surely he wants only one thing - war with the west.","",rashiv
STRM_23v10,"He took pages straight from Livanoch's book. Although this time he's not waving around with nuclear weapons. Not yet anyway.","",lemontov
STRM_23v11,"If he does have a plan similar to Livanoch, then he will plunge the world into a war of unprecedented destruction.\nHe must be stopped.","",staposhnikov
STRM_23v12,"Stopped? But you're talking treason!","",rashiv
STRM_23v13,"Yes, you might call us traitors. But we are only traitors to him, to the man willing to start a nuclear war and destroy us all.\nWe are only loyal to our country, more so than he is.","",lemontov
STRM_23v14,"Volkov is only loyal to himself.","",staposhnikov
STRM_23v15,"I brought you on board, Sergei, because I believe you see things in the same light as we do.\nWe cannot allow that madman to start World War Three.\nWe cannot allow him to destroy Mother Russia. The West. The World. He must be stopped.","",lemontov
STRM_23v16,"Livanoch had a mad plan and could not be allowed to execute it.\nDo you know what happened that day when the Americans came for him?\nI killed him. Shot him in the head. I could not go on anymore without doing anything.\nI had to act. Does that make me a traitor? Then so be it, but I would do it again.","",lemontov
STRM_23v17,"There are things worth dying for.\nAnd I am ready to make that sacrifice for our country and for the future of this world.","",lemontov
STRM_23v18,"Well said, Grigory, I agree.","",staposhnikov
STRM_23v19,"I'm.. I'm with you, of course. It's a lot to take in but I do think I understand.\nI am with you till the end, Stas, Grigory. You have my word and loyalty.","",rashiv
STRM_23v20,"That's what I wanted to hear. But we cannot act, not yet.\nVolkov has a plan - one that involves a fight with NATO on Everon, Kolguyev, maybe Malden, who knows.\nWe'll need to find out about this plan and act accordingly to stop it.\nVolkov cannot be allowed to succeed in whatever his endgame is.","",lemontov
STRM_23v21,"We shall stop him when the time is right. Together for victory!","",lemontov
STRM_23v22,"Together for victory!","",staposhnikov and rashiv

STRM_23v24,"Come on lads, enough lollygagging. Time to earn your pay.","",lemontov
STRM_23v25,"Comrade major, we follow you. In case you need any more charges, we have some in those crates.","",kaplinsky
