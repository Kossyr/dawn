STRM_23v01,"Thank you both for coming. We have matters to discuss.","",lemontov
STRM_23v02,"Our successful defence means we are on the offensive and victory on Kolguyev is only a matter of time.\nWe must start to look into the future.","",lemontov
STRM_23v03,"Stas reported me on your adventures on Everon, Sergei.\nIt is partly the reason why I promoted.\nI say partly because I saw your qualities first hand and Vadim's son cannot be anything but extraordinary.","",lemontov
STRM_23v04,"Thank you, Grigory. You flatter me.","",rashiv
STRM_23v05,"I wanted to meet so we can explain to you what is going on behind the scenes. Stas, you take it from here.","",lemontov
STRM_23v06,"There is a great tension in the world right now.\nFight for Everon is one thing, but NATO actually attacked a Sovet island.\nUnlike the first time, we didn't put a foot on Malden and NATO is now seen more as an aggresor.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v07,"The Kremlin was divided whether to support our effort here, but when we came close to actually losing the island, an army was sent.\nAll forces are under command of Vladimir Volkov and his dogs, namely Zubarev.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v08,"Now the question being what does Volkov plan to do with his newfound power.\nHe already had a sway in the Kremlin which just increased considerably.","",lemontov
STRM_23v09,"Do you think his aim is another world war? Like Livanoch?","",rashiv
STRM_23v10,"Volkov certainly seems to have taken notes from Livanoch's book.\nUntil he takes Malden though he cannot launch a nuclear strike, we should be grateful we are still on Kolguyev then.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v11,"We want you to join us, Sergei. If Volkov goes against the Kremlin, if he does go for the nuclear destruction, we must be there to stop him.\nAnother world war means an end for everyone, not only for the west. It must not happen.","",lemontov
STRM_23v12,"I understand, of course. My father sent me a lot of letters from the front before he got killed.\nHe would frequently mention the war was short sighted and could lead to an annihilation. I wasn't sure what he meant until I learned about Livanoch's plan.","",rashiv
STRM_23v13,"I think my father was against it. Maybe even tried to stop it. I see it in the same light, it would be a disaster of unprecedented magnitude.\nFather always spoke highly of you, Grigory, and I trust you. I am with you.","",rashiv
STRM_23v14,"Thank you, I appreciate it. but beware, we are on a thin ice. Technically what we're doing could be considered a treachery against Volkov.\nWe must be careful, learn more about his plans, expose him and if necessary, stop him before he does whatever his endgoal is.","",lemontov
STRM_23v15,"I understand and I am with you. I am Vadim's son, I will not let this happen as long as I breathe.","",rashiv
STRM_23v16,"Excellent. Then welcome, Sergei. We should stay low for now and gather more information. Stas has some contacts back in Moscow, we'll se what he can dig up. Me and you will keep both our eyes open. We must know what Volkov's plan is before we can stop it.","",lemontov
STRM_23v17,"I agree.","",rashiv
STRM_23v18,"Absolutely.","",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v19,"Don't tell anyone what was discussed here and don't meet publicly more than necessary. Do not underestimate Volkov, he is very dangerous.\nStay safe until our next meeting.","",comment

STRM_23v20,"Come on lads, enough lollygagging. Time to earn your pay.","",lemontov
STRM_23v21,"Comrade major, we follow you. In case you need any more charges, we have some in those crates.","",kaplinsky
