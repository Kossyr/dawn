STRM_23v01,"Thank you both for coming. We have matters to discuss.",lemontov
STRM_23v02,"Our successful defence means we are on the offensive and victory on Kolguyev is only a matter of time.\nWe must start to look into the future.",lemontov
STRM_23v03,"Stanislav reported me on your adventures on Everon, Sergey.\nIt is partly the reason why I promoted you.\nI say partly because I saw your qualities first hand and Vadim's son cannot be anything but extraordinary.",lemontov
STRM_23v04,"Thank you, Grigory. You flatter me.",rashiv
STRM_23v05,"I wanted to meet so we can explain to you what is going on behind the scenes. Stanislav, you take it from here.",lemontov
STRM_23v06,"There is great tension in the world right now.\nFight for Everon is one thing, but NATO actually attacked a Soviet island.\nUnlike the first time, we didn't put a foot on Malden and NATO is now seen more as an aggressor.",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v07,"Kremlin was divided on whether to support our effort here, but when we came close to actually losing the island, an army was sent.\nAll forces are under command of Vladimir Volkov and his dogs, namely Zubarev.",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v08,"Now the question being what does Volkov plan to do with his newfound power.\nHe already had a sway in Kremlin which just increased considerably.",lemontov
STRM_23v09,"Do you think his aim is another world war? Like Livanokh?",rashiv
STRM_23v10,"Volkov certainly seems to have taken notes from Livanokh's book.\nUntil he takes Malden though he cannot launch a nuclear strike, we should be grateful we are still on Kolguyev then.",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v11a,"We want you to join us, Sergey.\nIf Volkov goes against Kremlin, if he does go for the nuclear destruction, we must be there to stop him.",lemontov
STRM_23v11b,"Another world war means an end for everyone, not only for the west. It must not happen.",lemontov
STRM_23v12a,"I understand, of course. My father sent me a lot of letters from the front before he got killed.\nHe would frequently mention the war was short sighted and could lead to an annihilation.",rashiv
STRM_23v12b,"I wasn't sure what he meant until I learned about Livanokh's plan.",rashiv
STRM_23v13a,"I think my father was against it. Maybe even tried to stop it.\nI see it in the same light, it would be a disaster of unprecedented magnitude.",rashiv
STRM_23v13b,"I trust you, Grigory, and I am with you.",rashiv
STRM_23v14a,"Thank you, I appreciate it. But beware, we are on a thin ice.\nTechnically what we're doing could be considered a treachery against Volkov.",lemontov
STRM_23v14b,"We must be careful, learn more about his plans, expose him and if necessary, stop him before he does whatever his end goal is.",lemontov
STRM_23v15a,"We should stay low for now and gather more information.\nStanislav has some contacts back in Moscow, we'll see what he can dig up.",lemontov
STRM_23v15b,"Me and you will keep both our eyes open. We must know what Volkov's plan is before we can stop it.",lemontov
STRM_23v16,"I agree.",rashiv
STRM_23v17,"Absolutely.",shaposhnikov
STRM_23v18,"Don't tell anyone what was discussed here and don't meet publicly more than necessary.\nDo not underestimate Volkov, he is very dangerous. Stay safe until our next meeting.",lemontov

STRM_23v19,"Come on lads, enough lollygagging. Time to earn your pay.",lemontov
STRM_23v20,"Comrade major, we follow you. In case you need any more charges, we have some in those crates.",kaplinsky
