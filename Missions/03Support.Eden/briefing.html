        <b>3.11.1986</b> - This morning I thought about mother, who I never met, and father, who died in service years
        ago. I imagined what they would say - my father especially. He always believed in fairness and justice - which
        are hard to come by in the Soviet Union. He fought the Americans for this very island - before they put a bullet
        in his brain. Is it justice what we are doing here or revenge?
        <br><br>
        I try not to attract too much attention. I don't want it. I want... I'm actually not sure what I want. I used to
        think I wanted revenge on the Americans for what they did to my father, but after experiencing war for myself I
        do not think it is a course of action I can take anymore. War is bad enough without hatred and disdain on top of
        it. I do not wish to become an animal craving to kill.
        <br><br>
        Enough of bad thoughts. We have a new mission - to delay enemy forces until our own guys get to safety. Attack
        on Le Moule was a complete failure - lucky I was not part of it.
        <br><br>
        Talking about failures, we seized Provins yesterday - and held it for about two minutes before retreating to
        Figari, which we also lost after another hour. Now in the north we only hold Morton. With the defeat at Le Moule
        we are probably just about ready to head home again.

        An attack on Le Moule was repelled. Your goal is to support retreating units which are defending themselves at
        <a href="marker:podpora">these</a> positions and make sure they retreat back to the <a
            href="marker:statek">farm</a>. You must not allow the Americans to surround our units.
        <br><br>
        You start <a href="marker:start">en route</a> to Le Moule.

    <p>Lots of soldiers are indebted to you, comrade. You allowed our weakened units to retreat and repelled enemy
        pursuers. You have done well - know that HQ did notice. </p>
