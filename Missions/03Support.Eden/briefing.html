   <b>3rd November 1987</b> - This morning I thought about mother, who I never met, and father, who died in service years ago. I imagined what they would say - my father especially. He always believed in fairness and justice - which are hard to come by in the Soviet Union. He fought the Americans for this very island - before they put a bullet in his brain. Is it justice what we are doing here or revenge?
    <br><br>
    Enough of bad thoughts. We have a new mission - to delay enemy forces until our own guys get to safety. Attack on Le Moule was a complete failure - lucky I was not part of it.
    <br><br>
    Talking about failures, we seized Provins yesterday - and held it for about two minutes before retreating to Figari, which we also lost after another hour. We hold the southern part of the island and from the north we have only Morton. With the defeat at Le Moule we are probably just about ready to head home again.

   An attack on Le Moule was repelled. Your goal is to support retreating units which are defending themselves at <a href="marker:podpora">these</a> positions and make sure they retreat back to the <a href="marker:statek">farm</a>. You must not allow the Americans to surround our units. 
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:start">en route</a> to Le Moule.

	<p>Lots of soldiers are indebted to you, comrade. You allowed our weakened units to retreat and repelled enemy pursuers. You have done well - know that HQ did notice. </p>
