This is it, comrade Lemontov. This is what we have been fighting for. This is the moment everything has led up to. This is our final victory.
<br><br>
The goal is to seize the secret enemy facility and claim whatever it is they're harbouring in there.
<br><br>
Land on <a href="marker:Beach">the beaches</a> of the small island off the coast of Malden, push <a href="marker:ToBase2">northwards</a> towards <a href="marker:Base">the main enemy base</a> and seize it. Finally, take over the facility itself - <a href="marker:Hangars">the hangar area</a> in the centre of the island.
<br><br>
Expect heavy enemy resistance - the whole island is fortified and they seem to be expecting you. We spotted a few light tanks but mainly a great amount of infantry including special forces.
<br><br>
You start aboard <a href="marker:Start">boats</a> that will carry you to the landing beaches.

<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Land on the <a href="marker:Beach">southern beaches</a> of the island as the first wave of our attack. Our nearby <a href="marker:SovietFleet">fleet</a> is going to support you with artillery fire.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Fight your way through the beach defences and secure a <a href="marker:Beachhead">beachhead</a>. The rest of our troops and light tanks will be able to join you after you secure them enough space.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Neutralize the enemy position on <a href="marker:Hill">the hill</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Push <a href="marker:ToBase2">north</a> towards the base. Landings of our other troops are going to take place at this time.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Attack and seize <a href="marker:Base">the main enemy base</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_6"></a>Finish the mission by taking over <a href="marker:Hangars">the hangars</a> to the east.</p>
