<b>11th February 1989</b> - I spent enough pages talking - time for words is over. This is the time for action.
<br><br>
I did not expect to see my prison island ever again - my residence for over seven years and apparently also a home to the so-called "facility". Whateveter weapon it is the Americans got there, it makes Volkov's eyes glow every time he mensions it. They can't wait to get their hands on it - do they expect me to be one step ahead?
<br><br>
I'll be the first to the hangars. It is the greatest opportunity to stop this madness once and for all. With their forces bogged down at the facility, my allies on the main island will be able to disarm their followers - without the weapon and without an army they are doomed to fail.
<br><br>
That is the plan anyway. Nothing ever goes smoothly and I predict there is still a lot of blood to be shed before this is over.
<br><br>
I feel we have the upper hand. All the patience, the waiting and the grovelling is finally about to pay off. They don't have a reason to suspect I'm against them - they did give me the command of this assault after all. I am what Vadim was during the first war and I am going to destroy them from the inside.
<br><br>
The stakes are high. What if I miscalculated, missed something? What if it all horribly backfires? What if I fail and all that is left of me are dust and bones?
<br><br>
It's victory or death scenario. Not the first one, but perhaps my last. I am ready for anything at this point - and I shall give it my all. I shall keep on trying to my very last breath.
<br><br>
If I am to die today, I am going to do so with my head held high.

This is it, comrade Lemontov. This is what we have been fighting for. This is the moment everything has led up to. This is our final victory.
<br><br>
The goal is to seize the secret enemy facility and claim whatever it is they're harbouring in there.
<br><br>
Land on <a href="marker:Beach">the beaches</a> of the small island off the coast of Malden, push <a href="marker:ToBase2">northwards</a> towards <a href="marker:Base">the main enemy base</a> and seize it. Finally, take over the facility itself - <a href="marker:Hangars">the hangar area</a> in the centre of the island.
<br><br>
Expect heavy enemy resistance - the whole island is fortified and they seem to be expecting you. We spotted a few light tanks but mainly a great amount of infantry including special forces.
<br><br>
You start aboard <a href="marker:Start">boats</a> that will carry you to the landing beaches.
</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Land on the <a href="marker:Beach">southern beaches</a> of the island as the first wave of our attack. Our nearby <a href="marker:SovietFleet">fleet</a> is going to support you with artillery fire.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_2"></a>Fight your way through the beach defences and secure a <a href="marker:Beachhead">beachhead</a>. The rest of our troops and light tanks will be able to join you after you secure them enough space.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_3"></a>Neutralize the enemy position on <a href="marker:Hill">the hill</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_4"></a>Push <a href="marker:ToBase2">north</a> towards the base. Landings of our other troops are going to take place at this time.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_5"></a>Attack and seize <a href="marker:Base">the main enemy base</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OBJ_6"></a>Finish the mission by taking over <a href="marker:Hangars">the hangars</a> to the east.</p>
