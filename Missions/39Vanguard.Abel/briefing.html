<b>10th February 1989</b> - Malden, it has always been Malden.
<br><br>
During the first war, Livanokh led our forces. We pushed from the north and were close to completely defeating the enemy and taking over the whole island. The world might have been a different place today were we to succeed. George Dyaconsen and James Epgayd - the two American commanders who stood in our way. They rallied their defences and managed to push us back. It was a hard fought battle but in the end we were on the losing side.
<br><br>
After that, the war was lost. We were quickly overwhelmed on Everon and Kolguyev. Livanokh died, I was captured, and our nation's pride was shattered. Malden became the symbol of our shame and American superiority.
<br><br>
I thought Volkov might be after Malden - out of symbolism if not for anything else. But his plan is much more sinister - akin to the old Livanokh's own plan - starting a war of mutual destruction by firing the first shot. What does he hope to achieve? What's going to be left when the dust settles? Will humanity even survive it?
<br><br>
The facility... that's what they called it. The possibility of a weapon of mass destruction being developed right under our noses is frightening. Using it is unimaginable. 
<br><br>
We are firstly getting foothold on the island before attacking and seizing it. I still have time to gather strength and prepare.
<br><br>
If the Americans can't stop us, then it must be me.

It has been years since our last incursion on Malden and our defeat at the hands of the enemy. Now, we are finally ready to go back and finish this war for good.
<br><br>
The objective of the mission is to neutralize enemy anti-air guns around in the southern Malden so that our air force can conduct a raid on the enemy positions in a few hours. Don't waste your time destroying anything else.
<br><br>
We know of four approximate positions of the enemy guns - we need you to destroy at least three of them.
<br><br>
This is all in preparation for our morning invasion of Malden. You are the vanguard, comrade Lemontov.
<br><br>
You start on the <a href="marker:Start">coast</a> where you just landed.
