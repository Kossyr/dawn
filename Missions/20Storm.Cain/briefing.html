<b>7th December 1988</b> - Day four of my fighting for the Motherland.
<br><br>
We're going in as a spearhead in another major offensive. We don't have that many tanks this time since we lost a lot in the last attack, but it should be enough. The Spetsnaz did their thing during the night and we should have an easier time. What concerns me the most is the enemy counterattack. After our night raid the enemy is sure to know we're going to attack in the morning - so they have time to prepare a response. And if I heard right, it's going to be a heavy response...

You and your squad Yury are the spearhead of the early attack on enemy positions. Our goal is to seize <a href="marker:base">Malsk</a>. Spetsnaz already softened the defending armour during the night, but expect a stiff resistance as the enemy is entrenched. Once the base is seized, we expect a major counterattack from <a href="marker:counterattack">the road</a>. Anti-Tank squad <a href="marker:yelena">Yelena</a> and special forces <a href="marker:dmitri">Dmitry</a> will help you repel the enemy assault.
<br><br>
You start on the <a href="marker:start">road</a>.
