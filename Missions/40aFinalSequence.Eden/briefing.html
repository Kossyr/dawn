<b>10th February 1989</b> - Dearest Ekaterina,
<br><br>
I am not going to send you this letter. It is of no use. I know they've been reading my letters - and possibly already burned them on bonfires. How many of them I can't be sure. What are the last words that you received from me? I may never know for a great catastrophe is upon us.
<br><br>
I know not what is happening back home - no information of consequence ever reaches us. I don't even trust those messages that do - those that claim everything is as it has always been. I know that to be lie. What we do here resonates in the world, I am sure of that - and our already unstable government must be shaking to its very core.
<br><br>
We are attaking Malden, a US territory - it is assured to stir up the world scene. The Cuban missiles, those tanks staring each other down in Berlin streets - this is so much more that my hands are shaking as I write these words. What could be the situation in Europe? Are our armies preparing on the borders in battle formations? Are strategic plans being drawn? Are nuclear missiles ready to fire at a press of a button?
<br><br>
We are in a bubble here and nobody seems to realize these things. I was blind as well until I started to dig into it. Now I wish I have never done so.
<br><br>
I'm not really worried about myself - whatever happens to me, so be it. I am simply terrified at the thought that you might be in danger - and I am unable to do anything about it.
<br><br>
I hope I get to give you this letter one day. I'll be carrying it on me and if I don't make it back, I hope they find it in my pocket and give it to you. So that you know what transpired here, what I've been through and what I fought for.
<br><br>
I live and die for you, Ekaterina, in the hopes that it keeps you safe wherever you are.
<br><br>
Forever yours,<br>
Nikolay

Our spetsnaz commando successfully neutralized enemy air defence in southern Malden. You and your squadron are being tasked with flying to Malden and destroying as many enemy tanks as you can. 
<br><br>
The invasion forces are going in right after you. The more you destroy, the easier time they are going to have.
<br><br>
Be careful to the north of the island, as the enemy air defence there is fully intact. South is the only raid's objective. Good luck, comrades!

You start at the <a href="marker:Start">airport</a>.
