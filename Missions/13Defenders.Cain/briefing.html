<b>28th November 1988</b> - I did not sleep after my night shift. Nobody did. Everybody knew what special operatives sabotaging our defences meant - the enemy would launch the invasion soon. As it turns out, very soon - this very morning.
<br><br>
There is shelling outside my tent. Most of our tanks were destroyed. The men are now cowering in their tents, barracks or any other type of shelter. We're waiting for the enemy to come.

Intel suggests NATO will land across the whole southern part of the island. We had fortified several beaches - in the <a href="marker:WesternBeach">west</a>,  <a href="marker:SoutheasternBeach">south-east</a>,  <a href="marker:SouthernBeach">south</a> and  <a href="marker:EasternBeach">east</a>. There are also fortified positions which we are to defend from - <a href="marker:WesternBase">our position on the Barren Hill</a>, <a href="marker:SouthernBase">Solikhov</a>, <a href="marker:FuelBase">Tobol</a> and <a href="marker:EasternBase">Oka</a>.
<br><br>
Shelling stopped. There is uncomfortable silence now. Intimidating even. Now I can hear the engines. The boats are coming...

NATO launched an amphibious invasion of Kolguyev in the early hours this morning. We have to defend against this invasion and stop the enemy before they can get a foothold on the island.

You start at <a href="marker:Start">the Barren Hill</a>.

<br>
<p>We were prepared yet the enemy superiority won the day and we lost the southern part of the island. At least most of our men got away safely.</p>
