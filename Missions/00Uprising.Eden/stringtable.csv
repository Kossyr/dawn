STRM_00v01,"Citizens of the republic of Everon!\nThis is Colonel Johnson speaking, the commanding officer of the American forces that entered your island today.\nOn an invitation from your president Edouard Daladier,\nwe have come to offer you protection and safeguard your nation from outside threats.","",Johnson
STRM_00v02,"The Soviet forces on a nearby island of Kolguyev are amassing troops. Their activity in the past year has increased threefold.\nThey pose an imminent danger to your island.\nThey tried to claim Everon seven years ago and now it is all but certain they would try to do so again.","",johnson
STRM_00v03,"We saved you once before, dear citizens of Everon, and we are here to do the same.\nPlease do not resist our units and heed their orders.\nDo not try to get in our way for we will be forced to act harshly although we do not wish to, to keep you all safe.","",johnson
STRM_00v04,"You should feel safe as you go to sleep tonight knowing that our great forces watch over your shores, cities, farms and meadows.\nWe are your guardians and will put our lives on the line to make sure your island will never become another battlefield in the future.\nI wish you all goodnight!","",johnson

STRM_00v05,"Bunch of bullshit.","",Astier
STRM_00v06,"This is exactly the same as seven years ago. Only this time we actually invited them over.\nIs the price we paid in blood not enough to grant us peace?","",Astier
STRM_00v07,"Our bases were occupied. They commandeered our weapons, tanks and the few choppers that ve had.\nThe militia was disbanded and we are marked as traitors with orders to shoot on sight.","",Jean
STRM_00v08,"This is like a bad dream come true. How did it all go to shit so quickly?","",Astier
STRM_00v09,"It is not over, Gaston. We are still here, still fighting. You led us seven years ago even in the direst of situations.\nRemember the Soviets? Remember how shattered we were? You brought us back. You gave us our freedom.","",Jean
STRM_00v10,"The freedom which was taken away from us, I know.\nI hoped after the French legions and our departure from France we could find a place to live in peace.\nBut there is always something in the way, always!","",Astier
STRM_00v11,"But you are right. The battle is not over until there are people still willing to fight on.\nWe are the free people of Everon!\nWe deserve our freedom the same as everyone else! If freedom is not granted we shall fight for it!","",Astier
STRM_00v12,"Yeah, Gaston!","",partisans
STRM_00v13,"Hear, hear!","",partisans
STRM_00v14,"First, we need to send a message that we are still here and that we did not give up.\nDaladier betrayed our nation and thus I condemn him to death. We shall be the executors.","",Astier
STRM_00v15,"Get some sleep, we're starting in the morning.\nIt's time to rekindle the people's hearts again and together we shall drive the occupants back into the sea.\nFor free Everon we fight, the resistance reborn! Who's with me?!","",Astier
STRM_00v16,"For free Everon! Vivat Gaston! Vivat the resistance!","",everyone

STRM_00v19,"Get in the car. I'll explain the plan along the way.","",Astier
STRM_00v20,"Alright, men, listen up. Daladier is in Montignac and will be going to Sain Pierre shortly to pay a visit to that Johnson fella.","",Astier
STRM_00v21,"He will not arrive.","",Astier
STRM_00v22,"They know we're still out there, they'll want to secure him. He hates flying so they will send a convoy.\nI expect some infantry and a few armoured vehicles.","",Astier
STRM_00v23,"We will need to heavy weapons to deal with that. We'll get them from our American friends.\nI received news that ammo trucks were sent to Entre Deux. They should provide anything we might need.","",Astier
STRM_00v24,"They won't expect an attack so close to Montignac, but we'll need to be fast.\nWe take the trucks, meet the others on the farm between Chotain and Laruns.\nWe wait for the convoy and blast it to smithereens.","",Astier
STRM_00v25,"We know the land and we are determined. We'll get our island back from the occupants.\nGet ready, for the battle for our island starts at this moment!","",Astier
STRM_00v26,"We follow your lead, Gaston.","",Jean

STRM_00v27,"We're here. Let's go, men.","",Astier

STRM_00v28,"This is precisely what we need.","",Astier
STRM_00v29,"And there's even more of it there. We're gonna have to load it onto the trucks.","",Astier
STRM_00v30,"Jean, go get our jeep and park it here. We'll start hauling those crates.","",Astier

STRM_00v31,"We know you're in there. Walk out with your hands behind your head!","",American patrol
STRM_00v32,"We've got you surrounded. Surrender now and you can all return home!","",American patrol
STRM_00v33,"You have nowhere to go! Give up now!","",American patrol
STRM_00v34,"Alright, they do not care to listen to reason. Prepare the petrol, fire should force them out.","",American patrol

STRM_00v35,"The whoresons! I have to get rid of them before the men inside burn to death!","",Poincare

STRM_00v36,"That should be all of them. Now to free those inside the church.","",Poincare

STRM_00v37,"Thanks for the help. That was very close back there.","",Partisan
STRM_00v38,"No problem. What did you do to piss them off so much?","",Poincare
STRM_00v39,"We did have a shootout with them earlier and might have gotten a few.","",Partisan
STRM_00v40,"What happened?","",Poincare
STRM_00v41,"Wwhat do you think? We were on our way to the meeting point when we met a patrol.\nThere was a fight, we took them out, but then more of them came so we hid in the church.\nWe didn't think they would set it on fire.","",Partisan
STRM_00v42,"Hm, kind of makes on ewonder why those petrol canisters look like the ones we use for tractors.\nMust be a coincidence then?","",Poincare
STRM_00v43,"What are you on about, man? Alright, yes, we did plan to lure them here and set the church on fire.\nThough it got out of control and we were the ones inside the church and not the other way around.\nAre you a police or something? Why do you even care?","",""Partisan
STRM_00v44,"I do care because we're fighting for a just cause here. We are not freaking war criminals.\nIt's a fine line that you do not want to cross, believe me.","",Poincare
STRM_00v45,"Well, it was a stupid idea anyway. We hear you, man.","",Partisan 
STRM_00v46,"Good that you're all alive, men, but that church is beyond saving.\nWe should head out, we have a work to do. Get in and follow!","",Astier

STRM_00v47,"Alright everybody, thank you for coming. The convoy will be here soon. We are not many but we have suprise on our side.","",Astier
STRM_00v48,"We are team Fox, team Raven is on the other side of the road and will notify us when the convoy's coming.\nTogether we attack and destroy all opposition and seize our dear president Daladier, the traitor.","",Astier
STRM_00v49,"The convoy'll be here soon. Equip any weapon by your preference and get ready. We set out soon.","",Astier

STRM_00v50,"It was thrilling to do battle again. We once again fought for our freedom, for our island and nation.\nAnd once again we went against one of the strongest powers on Earth. But we were determined to fight till the bitter end.","",Poincare

STRM_00r01,"KEEP CLOSE IN FORMATION. WE'LL BE SWIFT AND WE'LL BE DEADLY. LET'S SHOW THEM HOW WE FIGHT ON EVERON!","",Astier
