STRM_00v01,"Citizens of the republic of Everon!\nThis is Colonel Johnson speaking, the commanding officer of the American forces that entered your island today.\nOn an invitation from your president Edouard Daladier,\nwe have come to offer you protection and safeguard your nation from outside threats.","",Johnson
STRM_00v02,"The Soviet forces on a nearby island of Kolguyev are amassing troops. Their activity in the past year has increased threefold.\nThey pose an imminent danger to your island.\nThey tried to claim Everon seven years ago and now it is all but certain they would try to do so again.","",johnson
STRM_00v03,"We saved you once before, dear citizens of Everon, and we are here to do the same.\nPlease do not resist our units and heed their orders.\nDo not try to get in our way for we will be forced to act harshly although we do not wish to, to keep you all safe.","",johnson
STRM_00v04,"You should feel safe as you go to sleep tonight knowing that our great forces watch over your shores, cities, farms and meadows.\nWe are your guardians and will put our lives on the line to make sure your island will never become another battlefield in the future.\nI wish you all goodnight!","",johnson

STRM_00v05,"Bunch of bullshit.","",Astier
STRM_00v06,"This is exactly the same as seven years ago. Only this time we actually invited them over.\nIs the price we paid in blood not enough to grant us peace?","",Astier
STRM_00v07,"Our bases were occupied. They commandeered our weapons, tanks and the few choppers that ve had.\nThe militia was disbanded and we are marked as traitors with orders to shoot on sight.","",Jean
STRM_00v08,"This is like a bad dream come true. How did it all go to shit so quickly?","",Astier
STRM_00v09,"It is not over, Gaston. We are still here, still fighting. You led us seven years ago even in the direst of situations.\nRemember the Soviets? Remember how shattered we were? You brought us back. You gave us our freedom.","",Jean
STRM_00v10,"The freedom which was taken away from us, I know.\nI hoped after the French legions and our departure from France we could find a place to live in peace.\nBut there is always something in the way, always!","",Astier
STRM_00v11,"But you are right. The battle is not over until there are people still willing to fight on.\nWe are the free people of Everon!\nWe deserve our freedom the same as everyone else! If freedom is not granted we shall fight for it!","",Astier
STRM_00v12,"Yeah, Gaston!","",partisans

STRM_00v15,"Get some sleep, we're starting in the morning.\nIt's time to rekindle the people's hearts again and together we shall drive the occupants back into the sea.\nFor free Everon we fight, the resistance reborn! Who's with me?!","",Astier
