   <b>30.11.1986</b> - They came. I've known since Everon they would come and they finally came. In strength. They kicked us out of southern sector in less than two hours. True are cassualties could have been higher but all are preparations were meaningless - the enemy just swept through. 
   <br><br>
   Our next line of defense is way up north and the next <a href="marker:zakladna">base</a> in their path is weakly defended and will not withold any major attack. Lemontov came to me in the morning and told me to come with him on a mission. Three men against a tank platoon. All we have is mines and AT missiles - and it's gonna have to be enough.

	A man is never bored with Lemontov it seems.

	Comrade Rashiv, we go as three into this action - me, Kaplinksy and you. You did well enough in Lamentin and I hope you will try even harder this time.
<br><br>
We've got intel about a tank column having left the <a href="marker:tanky">enemy territory</a> and heading for our weakly defended <a href="marker:zakladna">base</a>. If those tanks get through, our units will have serious problems so be sure not to miss!
<br><br>
We start <a href="marker:start">near</a> the road.
