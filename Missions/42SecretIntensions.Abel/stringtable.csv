; INTRO

Is this what it all comes down to, George?
When we last stood here not so long ago, you asked me to forgive you.
For what? Am I about to find out?



Didn't think I would be standing here so soon.

It is fitting it shall end where it all started.

We are as ready as we'll ever be.

It is time to end this one way or the other.



; Shaposhnikov

The name is the only thing I got from Moscow - Red Hand.
They're very secretive and elusive. Even my contacts at NKVD don't know much.
Their power is hard to estimate, but their traces can be found everywhere. I would go as far as to say they infiltrated most institutions at this point, not only the army.
If they're planning some form of a coup, they seem to be in a prime position and there's not much we can do about that right now.
Our goal is to stop them here. Whatever they want to do with that weapon, it ties into their overarching plan. 
Maybe it will be enough to stop them completely. We can wipe their remnansts once we return to Russia.
There will be cleaning up to do either way.
Understood. The command centre, how many do you think are with them?
Most likely all of them. I don't trust anyone.
Do you have a plan?
Be first to the weapon, destroy it or neutralize it. Take control of the army, hopefully without bloodshed.
Are you sure going in alone is a good idea?
I need you all here. Once I give the signal, be ready to disarm their followers and take over all the bases. If we're fast enough, this can all end in a few hours without additional cassualities.
Fighting our countrymen is the last thing I want and should be avoided at all cost.
When you've returned last year, I knew that change was coming. If anyone can stop this madness, it is you.
Thank you, Stanislav, for everything. We wouldn't be standing here without your intervention. I said it before, but I am sorry for trying to have you killed.
That's behind us, I've already forgiven you. It's been an honour, Grigory.
I'll see you after it's done, Stanislav. Be ready and good luck.
Best of luck to you, Grigory. We'll be all waiting for you - end this war once and for all.


; Volkov's squad roll out

Comrades, friends, we are finally close - our goal is only a stone throw away.
We fought hard and sacrificed a lot to be able to stand here at this moment. But it's all about to be worth it.
The future of the world rests on our shoulders. It is high time we enter new age!
The Americans are convinced of their superiority. Let us show them how wrong they are!
Let us show them true power. The world will not be the same when the sun rises tomorrow!
Onwards, to the facility! One last step, comrades, in our path to final victory!
What comrade Livanokh started years ago, we shall finish today.
Let the battle be joined!


My only regret is that he didn't live to see this. We would make him proud, comrades!

; Zubarev

I must say, the rumours did not exaggerate - you truly are a remarkable commander. Your skills brought us here and I respect that.
That is rich coming from you.
You now have the possibility to redeem yourself and bring us victory. 
What do you mean, redeem?
Comrade Livanokh's death was your failure - he depended on you, trusted you to protect him. You failed.
Thank you for reminding me.
It shoud give you closure and relief finishing his work, right? Be thankful you got that chance, without us, you would still be rotting in prison.
Seize the weapon, Lemontov, end this. We'll be waiting.


; Rashiv (Rashiv is seen at first talking with Nikolay)

They didn't keep you in the hospital?
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Physically, maybe. But you seem to be at a bad place emotionally.
I realized a few things and I can't shake the feeling something terrible is about to happen.
Are you that anxious? I mean, enemy territory and all that, but we've been fighting for months now.
Something's fishy, Sergey. 


Wisdom onto me
Vadim flashback

If you don't trust my word, then we have nothing more to discuss on this matter.
Do know that you should know all parts of the equation before passing judgment.

; Giving signals - Kuznetsov, Shaposhnikov, Frolov, Randos ? -> Medic


; Lemontov final words

Either we succeed or the world will burn.

There is no going back. 

Whatever it is, I have to destroy it before they have a chance to use it.

We are ready as we'll every be. It is now or never.
Let us end this once and for all.
