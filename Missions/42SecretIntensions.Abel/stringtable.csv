; INTRO

Is this what it all comes down to, George?
When we last stood here not so long ago, you asked me to forgive you.
For what? Am I about to find out?



Didn't think I would be standing here so soon.

It is fitting it shall end where it all started.

We are as ready as we'll ever be.

It is time to end this one way or the other.



; Shaposhnikov

The name is the only thing I got from Moscow - Red Hand.
They're very secretive and elusive. Even my contacts at NKVD don't know much.
Their power is hard to estimate, but their traces can be found everywhere. I would go as far as to say they infiltrated most institutions at this point, not only the army.
If they're planning some form of a coup, they seem to be in a prime position and there's not much we can do about that right now.
Our goal is to stop them here. Whatever they want to do with that weapon, it ties into their overarching plan.
Maybe it will be enough to stop them completely. We can wipe their remnansts once we return to Russia.
There will be cleaning up to do either way.
Understood. The command centre, how many do you think are with them?
Most likely all of them. I don't trust anyone.
Do you have a plan?
Be first to the weapon, destroy it or neutralize it. Take control of the army, hopefully without bloodshed.
Are you sure going in alone is a good idea?
I need you all here. Once I give the signal, be ready to disarm their followers and take over all the bases. If we're fast enough, this can all end in a few hours without additional cassualities.
Fighting our countrymen is the last thing I want and should be avoided at all cost.
When you've returned last year, I knew that change was coming. If anyone can stop this madness, it is you.
Thank you, Stanislav, for everything. We wouldn't be standing here without your intervention. I said it before, but I am sorry for trying to have you killed.
That's behind us, I've already forgiven you. It's been an honour, Grigory.
I'll see you after it's done, Stanislav. Be ready and good luck.
Best of luck to you, Grigory. We'll be all waiting for you - end this war once and for all.


; Volkov's squad roll out

Comrades, friends, we are finally close - our goal is only a stone throw away.
We fought hard and sacrificed a lot to be able to stand here at this moment. But it's all about to be worth it.
The future of the world rests on our shoulders. It is high time we enter new age!
The Americans are convinced of their superiority. Let us show them how wrong they are!
Let us show them true power. The world will not be the same when the sun rises tomorrow!
Onwards, to the facility! One last step, comrades, in our path to final victory!
What comrade Livanokh started years ago, we shall finish today.
Let the battle be joined!

----

My only regret is that he didn't live to see this. We would make him proud, comrades!

; Zubarev

I know we've had our differences, comrade Lemontov.
That's one way to put it.
I did not trust you and I still have my reservations about you, but you are a formidable opponent.
I recognize it was you who brought us here. You managed to stop the enemy on Kolguyev...
In spite of your meddling...
You smashed both the Americans and the rebels on Everon...
If that's what you call an execution...
You proved yourself. You showed us what you are capable of and what you're willing to do for the greater good. 
You shall lead the final charge on the facility.
Seize the weapon, comrade Lemontov, end this. We'll be waiting.

----

You seem nervous, comrade Lemontov.
I'm not.
This is as far as you have gotten before, right? And now you've back at the same place in a different time. We have come a full circle.
We are here to break the circle, Zubarev.

I did not trust you when I met you, but it was you who brought us here. You won on Kolguyev, you smashed both the Americans and the rebels on Everon...


; Rashiv (Rashiv is seen at first talking with Nikolay)


They didn't keep you long at the hospital.
I'm telling you, I'm fine. It's my head that's meseed up.
What's wrong, Nikolay? Is Ekaterina all right?
I don't know that, Sergey. I don't know what's going on anymore.
It's going to end soon, stop worrying. Did something happen to make you feel anxious?
No, no, nothing happened...
You keep looking that way. Did you have business with Belsky, the postmaster?
Don't ask, Sergey, please.
You can talk to me. Did he give you her responses? Does he have any information?
That's the thing, Sergey, he has nothing. More likely all my letters were already burned.
What are you talking about?
You haven't noticed all the red flags? We are already dead, friend.
You must have lost your mind, Nikolay. You speak nonsense.
I wish. All information is controlled, we are kept in the blind. Is that so that the party can sacrifice us to start the next big war?
Or are we following someone else's orders and committing treason? We're screwed either way.
We are just pawns in all of this. I couldn't care less if only I knew my loved ones are safe. But we can't be sure Europe is not already burning.
Nikolay, we are at the edge of the world. We don't affect the global politics at all, we are too insignificant for that. Surely, everybody at home is fine.
You can't be sure, Sergey, because you don't know. We have no idea.
I don't trust this secrecy, I truly don't. I know something is not right and I fear what comes next.
Let me talk to Belsky, clear this out. You seem really stressed by it.
Don't, Sergey, don't talk...

Hello, Sergey.
Comrade Lemontov!
At ease, comrade. I would like to have a private word with comrade Rashiv.
By all means, comrade, I'm already gone!
What do you want, Grigory?
To talk. That's all.
I've been trying to talk to you for weeks to no avail.
I am sorry about that, but I had my reasons. Can we go somewhere more private?
What if I don't care what you have to say anymore?
I am about to take part in the final assault - it is going decide it all, change things forever. I may not come back.
I owe you answers. Please, Sergey, follow me.
Lead the way.

Is this private enough?
You still don't realize how dangerous the situation is.
I don't have much reason. We are on Malden and the world is still intact.
We are about to strike at the small island to the east - that is where this war is going to be decided.
That's where you're going to save the world?
Your sarcasm is unnecessary. I'm serious, Sergey.
I was also serious when I asked you not to kill the rebels.
Is that the sole reason you are angry with me?
One of many.
-- Saved the rebels
You should know there's the general truth that people believe, the course of events I wanted to be known.
And then there are the facts, the hard truth, of what truly transpired. You should rest well for your rebels are all safe and sound.
What is that bullshit?
Don't you see, Sergey? I needed to prove myself to Volkov by doing his bidding.
If there was no other way I would have killed them per my orders - too much is at stake to make mistakes. Fortunately, I did find a way for them to live.
Do you think I'll believe that? Nobody has seen them since.
I'm no amateur, Sergey. If you don't trust my word, then we have nothing more to discuss on this matter.
Do know that you should know all parts of the equation before passing judgment.
-- Killed the rebels
You should understand my position - I needed to prove myself to Volkov by doing his bidding.
I tried to find a way for them to live, to trick our enemy. Unfortunately, I couldn't stop the execution from going through.
Too much is at stake to make mistakes. It is not something I am proud of, but the truth of the matter is that their deaths were necessary for us to stop the threat that is Volkov.
I promised them I would bring them peace. But bringing you I signed their death warrants.
My conscience is clear. They were soldiers and in my position they would have not acted differently. Sometimes you have to sacrifice things in order to achieve higher goal.
And our goal is to stop the madness that's about to transpire. It is our duty to see things through.
--
But that's not what I wanted to talk about.
What is it? Any more enlightening wisdom for you to pass on me?

... more wisdom for you to pass on me?
This is no joke, Vadim. We are losing ground, hard.
They've got all our plans. What did you expect?
They knew exactly where and when to strike. They went straight for the jugular.
Are you implying something, Grigory?
It's obvious they knew, Vadim. There is a traitor in our midst.
Do you happen to know anything about it?
Are you implying I had something to do with it?
You worked in the communications before. You are an expert on short transmission radio frequencies.
Are you seriously accusing me?
Come on, Vadim, I'm asking everyone. Did you happen to notice anything out of the ordinary the last couple of days?
The fact you have to ask at all is insulting enough.
Stop with the theatrics and answer me, Vadim.
No, I don't have anything to do with the command centre raid. Happy?
Come on, man, I believed you even before you said that. I just can't figure out who would be doing this and why.
Maybe you are not looking high enough.
You mean..? What?
You've been following Alexander Livanokh for a very long time. Didn't you notice anything since the start of the war?
Nothing unusual, no.
I think you should be more careful who you put your trust in.
Sasha is a brother to me. I would never question him, Vadim.
It makes you blind and vulnerable, Grigory.
The whole point of this ordeal might be something you are not yet aware of. Something you might not agree with.
You should keep both your eyes open.
I always do. I don't like what you are implying, Vadim.
Am I implying anything? Grigory, old friend, all I'm saying is you should be on your guard. There might be more at stake here than meets the eye.
Just be careful, all right? With both friends and enemies.
You drank too much yesterday, haven't you?
Just forget it. I have to get back, Grigory, see you soon.
Goodbye, Vadim.

Grigory, are you all right? I kind of lost you there for a second.
An old memory. Sergey, there is something I should have told you long before. The truth about your father.
You deserve to know and I am selfish for keeping it from you.
I should have told you the moment we've met. But I did not want to lose you so early. I wanted to keep you close and protect you.
By inviting you to our plan, I did the exact opposite. It is safer for you to stay away and that's why I avoided all contact the last few weeks.
But I should have been more forthcoming. I convinced myself that by not telling you about your father that I was somehow easing you the pain.
The truth is, I was scared of losing you. In the end, I was just postponing the inevitable. It is time you know the true story.
You were close to my father, weren't you?
We were friends. He was one of the best men I ever met.
During the war, someone was feeding the Americans a lot of information. It led to us getting defeated here on Malden and essentially losing the war.
One night on Everon, I corneder Stanislav Shaposhnikov. His testimony did not match and I knew he was working for the spy.
I forced him to reveal his name - it was your father.
My father was a traitor?
He made sure we lost, he made sure that Alexander Livanokh lost. But he was no traitor for we were the traitors.
Livanokh wanted to plunge the world into an apocalypse by firing multiple nuclear warheads into the United States. He almost succeeded.
At the time, I was on his side. I didn't know what he was planning. When I learned what Vadim had done, I took it to Livanokh.
What happened?
The whole platoon was in it, so we drove to their base to punish those that we considered traitors.
What... happened... Grigory?
There is only one punishment for treason and that is death.
Sergey, I killed your father.
What?
Alexander ordered me to shoot and that's what I did. He died by my hand.
What the fuck, Grigory? This is insane!
It is my greatest mistake and not a single day goes by that I do not regret it.
Fuck me for thinking you were different, you are an actual murderer!
I would understand if you shot me right now, although I would prefer if you did not.
Grigory, I thought I hated you for killing the rebels. How do you think I feel after this? You killed my own father!
I believed he died in battle for his country at the very fucking least, but you simply butchered him!
He was a hero trying to stop a madman and his reward was death?!
It is not fair, Sergey...
It's not fucking close to being fair, Grigory! You knew this all this time, you shot him yourself and had the audacity to lie to my face?!
I never lied, Sergey, I only did not tell you the whole truth.
And that makes it better?
No. I already said I should have told you no matter the circumstances.
I am sorry about your father. I am sorry it had to be me.
I can't ever forgive you for killing my father, Grigory, ever! If Volkov doesn't kill you then I certainly will!
I understand. I wanted you to know before the end.
So that you can die with clear conscience?
No, so that you know all the pieces of the puzzle. The people who served Livanokh are on this island right now and they are about to fullfil his plan.
I am going to try to stop them, but If I don't succeed, you should be the one to finish the job.
They are who your father fought against and in essence they are the ones who killed him.
But you pushed the trigger.
I did and I will burn in hell for all eternity for that. But right now, I need to avert an unprecented catastrophe.
You make everything about Volkov and Livanokh, everything!
Because this has all been about it! All the conspiracies, all the suffering, all the deaths, everything led to this.
Your father was part of this struggle, a small and significant part, but it has always been about the apocalyptic event of mutually assured destruction.
We are once again close to annihilation. Ponder these words, Sergey, your father died for them.
I'm sorry, Grigory, I can't even look at you right now...
Completely understandable. I hope I get to talk to you again... to say sorry one more time, because I truly am.
No matter what you think, I wanted to protect you. I didn't want you to end up like Vadim.
I should have trusted you. I should have realized you were strong enough to bear the truth.
I am sorry. Goodbye, Sergey.

----

They didn't keep you in the hospital?
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Physically, maybe. But you seem to be at a bad place emotionally.
I realized a few things and I can't shake the feeling something terrible is about to happen.
Are you that anxious? I mean, enemy territory and all that, but we've been fighting for months now.
Something's fishy, Sergey.

; Giving signals - Kuznetsov, Shaposhnikov, Frolov, Randos ? -> Medic

Lemontov says - get ready for the signal.
So it is time. Finally.

; Lemontov final words

Either we succeed or the world will burn.

There is no going back. 

Whatever it is, I have to destroy it before they have a chance to use it.

We are ready as we'll every be. It is now or never.
Let us end this once and for all.
