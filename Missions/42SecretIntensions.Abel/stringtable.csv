STRM_42v01,"Is this what it all comes down to, George?",Lemontov
STRM_42v02,"Never thought I'd be back so soon. All roads lead to Malden and this island in particular.",Lemontov
STRM_42v03,"Am I supposed to know what's in there and how to stop it?",Lemontov
STRM_42v04,"Are we about to meet as you foretold?",Lemontov

; Shaposhnikov

STRM_42v05,"The name is the only thing I got from Moscow - Red Hand.",Shaposhnikovc
STRM_42v06,"They're very secretive and elusive. Even my contacts at NKVD don't know much.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v07,"Their power is hard to estimate, but their traces can be found everywhere. I would go as far as to say they infiltrated most institutions at this point, not only the army.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v08,"If they're planning some form of a coup, they seem to be in a prime position and there's not much we can do about that right now.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v09,"Our goal is to stop them here. Whatever they want to do with that weapon, it ties into their overarching plan.",Lemontov
STRM_42v10,"Maybe it will be enough to stop them completely. We can wipe their remnants once we return to Russia.",Lemontov
STRM_42v11,"There will be cleaning up to do either way.",Lemontov
STRM_42v12,"Understood. The command centre, how many do you think are with them?",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v13,"Most likely all of them. I don't trust anyone.",Lemontov
STRM_42v14,"What's the plan?",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v15,"Be first to the weapon, destroy it or neutralize it. Take control of the army, hopefully without bloodshed.",Lemontov
STRM_42v16,"Are you sure going in alone is a good idea?",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v17,"I need you here. Once I give the signal, be ready to disarm their followers and take over all the bases. If we're fast enough, this can all end in a few hours without additional cassualities.",Lemontov
STRM_42v18,"Fighting our countrymen is the last thing I want and should be avoided at all cost.",Lemontov
STRM_42v19,"When you've returned last year, I knew that change was coming. If anyone can stop this madness, it is you.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v20,"Thank you, Stanislav, for everything. We wouldn't be standing here without your intervention. I said it before, but I am sorry for trying to have you killed.",Lemontov
STRM_42v21,"That's behind us, I've already forgiven you. It's been an honour, Grigory.",Shaposhnikov
STRM_42v22,"I'll see you after it's done, Stanislav. Take care until then.",Lemontov
STRM_42v23,"Best of luck to you, Grigory. Eend this war once and for all.",Shaposhnikov

STRM_42v38,"I did not trust you and I still have my reservations about you, but you are a formidable opponent.",Zubarev
STRM_42v39,"I recognize it was you who brought us here. You managed to stop the enemy on Kolguyev...",Zubarev
STRM_42v40,"In spite of your meddling...",Lemontov
STRM_42v41,"You smashed both the Americans and the rebels on Everon...",Zubarev
STRM_42v42,"If that's what you call an execution...",Lemontov

STRM_42v46,"All that was supposed to be spoken was said. There are no more questions to be answered, no other obstacles to overcome.",Lemontov

STRM_42v50,"They didn't keep you long at the hospital.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v51,"I'm telling you, I'm fine. It's my head that's messed up.",Ablomov
STRM_42v52,"What's wrong, Nikolay? Is Ekaterina all right?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v53,"I don't know that, Sergey. I don't know what's going on anymore.",Ablomov
STRM_42v54,"It's going to end soon, stop worrying. Did something happen to make you feel anxious?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v55,"No, no, nothing happened...",Ablomov
STRM_42v56,"You keep looking that way. Did you have business with Belsky, the postmaster?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v57,"Don't ask, Sergey, please.",Ablomov
STRM_42v58,"You can talk to me. Did he give you her responses? Does he have any information?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v59,"That's the thing, Sergey, he has nothing. More likely all my letters were already burned.",Ablomov
STRM_42v60,"What are you talking about?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v61,"You haven't noticed all the red flags? We are already dead, friend.",Ablomov
STRM_42v62,"You must have lost your mind, Nikolay. You speak nonsense.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v63,"I wish. All information is controlled, we are kept in the blind. Is that so we can be sacrificed to start the next big war?",Ablomov
STRM_42v64,"Or are we following someone else's orders and committing treason? We're screwed either way.",Ablomov
STRM_42v65,"We are just pawns in all of this. I couldn't care less if only I knew my loved ones are safe. But we can't be sure Europe is not already burning.",Ablomov
STRM_42v66,"Nikolay, we are at the edge of the world. We don't affect the global politics at all, we are too insignificant for that. Surely, everybody at home is fine.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v67,"You can't be sure, Sergey, because you don't know. We have no idea.",Ablomov
STRM_42v68,"I don't trust this secrecy, I truly don't. I know something is not right and I fear what comes next.",Ablomov
STRM_42v69,"Let me talk to Belsky, clear this up. You seem really stressed by it.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v70,"Don't, Sergey, don't talk to...",Ablomov

STRM_42v71,"Hello, Sergey.",Lemontov
STRM_42v72,"Comrade Lemontov!",Ablomov
STRM_42v73,"At ease, comrade. I would like to have a private word with comrade Rashiv.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v74,"By all means, comrade, I'm already gone!",Ablomov
STRM_42v75,"What do you want, Grigory?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v76,"To talk. That's all.",Lemontov
STRM_42v77,"I've been trying to talk to you for weeks to no avail.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v78,"I am sorry about that, but I had my reasons. Can we go somewhere more private?",Lemontov
STRM_42v79,"What if I don't care what you have to say anymore?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v80,"I am about to take part in the final assault - it is going decide it all, change things forever. I may not come back.",Lemontov

STRM_42v82,"Lead the way.",Sergey Rashiv

; Sergey Rashiv and Lemontov, part 1

STRM_42v83,"Is this private enough for you?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v84,"You still don't realize how dangerous the situation is.",Lemontov
STRM_42v85,"I don't have much reason. We are on Malden and the world is still intact.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v86,"We are about to strike at the small island to the east - that is where this war is going to be decided.",Lemontov
STRM_42v87,"That's where you're going to save the world?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v88,"Your sarcasm is unnecessary. I'm serious, Sergey.",Lemontov
STRM_42v89,"I was also serious when I asked you not to kill the rebels.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v90,"Is that the reason you are angry with me?",Lemontov
STRM_42v91,"One of many.",Sergey Rashiv
-- Saved the rebels
STRM_42v92,"You should know there's the general truth that people believe, the course of events I wanted to be known.",Lemontov
STRM_42v93,"And then there are the facts, the hard truth, of what truly transpired. You should rest well for your rebels are all safe and sound.",Lemontov
STRM_42v94,"What is that bullshit?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v95,"Don't you see, Sergey? I needed to prove myself to Volkov by doing his bidding.",Lemontov
STRM_42v96,"If there was no other way I would have killed them per my orders - too much is at stake to make mistakes. Fortunately, I did find a way for them to live.",Lemontov
STRM_42v97,"Do you think I'll believe that? Nobody has seen them since.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v98,"I'm no amateur, Sergey. If you don't trust my word, then we have nothing more to discuss on this matter.",Lemontov
STRM_42v99,"Do know that you should know all parts of the equation before passing judgement.",Lemontov
-- Killed the rebels
STRM_42v100,"You should understand my position - I needed to prove myself to Volkov by doing his bidding.",Lemontov
STRM_42v101,"I tried to find a way for them to live, to trick our enemy. Unfortunately, I couldn't stop the execution from going through.",Lemontov
STRM_42v102,"Too much is at stake to make mistakes. It is not something I am proud of, but the truth of the matter is that their deaths were necessary for us to stop the threat that is Volkov.",Lemontov
STRM_42v103,"I promised them I would bring them peace. But bringing you I signed their death warrants.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v104,"My conscience is clear. They were soldiers and in my position they would have not acted differently. Sometimes you have to sacrifice things in order to achieve higher goal.",Lemontov
STRM_42v105,"And our goal is to stop the madness that's about to transpire. It is our duty to see things through.",Lemontov

STRM_42v110,"They've got all our plans. What did you expect?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v111,"They knew exactly where and when to strike. They went straight for the jugular.",Lemontov
STRM_42v112,"Your point, Grigory?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v113,"It's obvious they knew, Vadim. There is a traitor in our midst.",Lemontov
STRM_42v114,"Do you happen to know anything about it?",Lemontov
STRM_42v115,"Are you implying I had something to do with it?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v116,"You worked in the communications before. You are an expert on short transmission radio frequencies.",Lemontov
STRM_42v117,"Are you seriously accusing me?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v118,"Come on, Vadim, I'm asking everyone. Did you happen to notice anything out of the ordinary the last couple of days?",Lemontov
STRM_42v119,"The fact you have to ask at all is insulting enough.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v120,"Stop with the theatrics and answer me, Vadim.",Lemontov
STRM_42v121,"No, I don't have anything to do with the command centre raid. Happy?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v122,"Come on, man, I believed you even before you said that. I just can't figure out who would be doing this and why.",Lemontov
STRM_42v123,"Maybe you are not looking high enough.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v124,"You mean..? What?",Lemontov
STRM_42v125,"You've been following Alexander Livanokh for a very long time. Didn't you notice anything since the start of the war?",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v126,"Nothing unusual, no.",Lemontov
STRM_42v127,"I think you should be more careful who you put your trust in.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v128,"Sasha is like a brother to me. I would never question him, Vadim.",Lemontov
STRM_42v129,"It makes you blind and vulnerable, Grigory.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v130,"The whole point of this ordeal might be something you are not yet aware of. Something you might not agree with.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v131,"You should keep both your eyes open.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v132,"I always do. I don't think I like what you are implying, Vadim.",Lemontov
STRM_42v133,"Am I implying anything? Grigory, old friend, all I'm saying is you should be on your guard. There might be more at stake here than meets the eye.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v134,"Just be careful, all right? With both friends and enemies.",Vadim Rashiv
STRM_42v135,"You drank too much yesterday, haven't you?",Lemontov
STRM_42v136,"Just forget it. I have to get back, Grigory, see you soon.",Vadim Rashiv

STRM_42v138,"Grigory, are you all right? I kind of lost you there for a second.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v139,"An old memory. Sergey, there is something I should have told you long before. The truth about your father.",Lemontov
STRM_42v140,"You deserve to know and I am selfish for keeping it from you.",Lemontov
STRM_42v141,"I should have told you the moment we've met. But I didn't wnat to hurt you. I wanted to keep you close and keep an eye on you.",Lemontov
STRM_42v142,"By inviting you to our plan, I did the exact opposite. It is safer for you to stay away and that's why I avoided all contact the last few weeks.",Lemontov
STRM_42v143,"I should have been more forthcoming. I convinced myself that by not telling you about your father that I was somehow easing you the pain.",Lemontov
STRM_42v144,"The truth is, I was scared of losing you. In the end, I was just postponing the inevitable. It is time you know the true story.",Lemontov
STRM_42v145,"You were close to my father, weren't you?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v146,"We were friends. He was one of the best men I ever met.",Lemontov
STRM_42v147,"During the war, someone was feeding the Americans a lot of information. It led to us getting defeated here on Malden and essentially losing the war.",Lemontov
STRM_42v148,"One night on Everon, I cornered Stanislav Shaposhnikov. His testimony did not match and I knew he was working for the spy.",Lemontov
STRM_42v149,"I forced him to reveal their name - it was your father.",Lemontov
STRM_42v150,"My father was a traitor?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v151,"He made sure we lost, he made sure that Alexander Livanokh lost. But he was no traitor for we were the traitors.",Lemontov
STRM_42v152,"Livanokh wanted to plunge the world into an apocalypse by firing multiple nuclear warheads into the United States. He almost succeeded.",Lemontov
STRM_42v153,"At the time, I was on his side. I didn't know what he was planning. When I learned what Vadim had done, I took it to Livanokh.",Lemontov
STRM_42v154,"What happened?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v155,"The whole platoon was in it, so we drove to their base to punish those that we considered traitors.",Lemontov
STRM_42v156,"What... happened... Grigory?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v157,"There is only one punishment for treason and that is death.",Lemontov
STRM_42v158a,"Sergey...",Lemontov
STRM_42v158b,"... I killed your father.",Lemontov
STRM_42v159,"What? What?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v160,"Alexander ordered me to shoot and that's what I did. He died by my hand.",Lemontov
STRM_42v161,"Oh my god, Grigory, what?! You?!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v162,"It is my greatest mistake and not a single day goes by that I do not regret it.",Lemontov
STRM_42v163,"Fuck me for thinking you were different, you are an actual murderer!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v164,"I would understand if you shot me right now, although I would prefer if you did not.",Lemontov
STRM_42v165,"I thought I hated you for killing the rebels. How do you think I feel after this? You killed my own father!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v166,"I believed he died in battle for his country at the very fucking least, but you executed him like some lowlife!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v167,"He was a hero trying to stop a madman and his reward was death?!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v168,"It is not fair, Sergey...",Lemontov
STRM_42v169,"It's not fucking close to being fair, Grigory! You knew this all this time, you shot him yourself and still had the audacity to lie to my face?!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v170,"I never lied, Sergey, I only did not tell you the whole truth.",Lemontov
STRM_42v171,"And that makes it better?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v172,"No. I already said I should have told you no matter the circumstances.",Lemontov
STRM_42v173,"I am sorry about your father. I am sorry it had to be me.",Lemontov
STRM_42v174,"I can't ever forgive you for killing my father, Grigory, ever! If Volkov doesn't kill you then I certainly will!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v175,"I understand. I wanted you to know before the end.",Lemontov
STRM_42v176,"So that you can die with clear conscience?",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v177,"No, so that you know all the pieces of the puzzle. The people who served Livanokh are on this island right now and they are about to fullfil his plan.",Lemontov
STRM_42v178,"I am going to try to stop them, but If I don't succeed, you should be the one to finish the job.",Lemontov
STRM_42v179,"They are who your father fought against and in essence they are the ones who killed him.",Lemontov
STRM_42v180,"But you pushed the trigger.",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v181,"I did and I will burn in Hell for all eternity for that. But right now, I need to avert an unprecedented catastrophe.",Lemontov
STRM_42v182,"You make everything about Volkov and Livanokh, everything!",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v183,"Because this has all been about it! All the conspiracies, all the suffering, all the deaths, everything led to this.",Lemontov
STRM_42v184,"Your father was part of this struggle, a small and significant part, this has always been about the apocalyptic event of mutually assured destruction.",Lemontov
STRM_42v185,"We are once again close to annihilation. Ponder these words, Sergey, your father died for them.",Lemontov
STRM_42v186,"I'm sorry, Grigory, I can't even look at you right now...",Sergey Rashiv
STRM_42v187,"Completely understandable. I hope I get to talk to you again... to say sorry one more time, because I truly am.",Lemontov
STRM_42v188,"No matter what you think, I wanted to protect you. I didn't want you to end up like Vadim.",Lemontov
STRM_42v189,"I should have trusted you. I should have realized you were strong enough to bear the truth.",Lemontov
STRM_42v190,"Go to Hell, Grigory.",Sergey Rashiv
