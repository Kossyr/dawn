; INTRO

Is this what it all comes down to, George?
When we last stood here not so long ago, you asked me to forgive you.
For what? Am I about to find out?



Didn't think I would be standing here so soon.

It is fitting it shall end where it all started.

We are as ready as we'll ever be.

It is time to end this one way or the other.

Red Hand
thank you stanislav




; Volkov's squad roll out

Comrades, friends, we are finally close - our goal is only a stone throw away.
We fought hard and sacrificed a lot to be able to stand here at this moment. But it's all about to be worth it.
The future of the world rests on our shoulders. It is high time we enter new age!
The Americans are convinced of their superiority. Let us show them how wrong they are!
Let us show them true power. The world will not be the same when the sun rises tomorrow!
Onwards, to the facility! One last step, comrades, in our path to final victory!
What comrade Livanokh started years ago, we shall finish today.
Let the battle be joined!

My only regret is that he didn't live to see this. We would make him proud, comrades!

; Lemontov final words

Either we succeed or the world will burn.

There is no going back. 

Whatever it is, I have to destroy it before they have a chance to use it.

We are ready as we'll every be. It is now or never.
Let us end this once and for all.
