<b>9th December 1988</b> - it feels like yesterday when I fought on Everon as a mere private, blissfully ignorant to all around me. I was reticent, not showing any signs of emotion or thoughts - at least on the surface. My father's death meant my world turned upside down and I was never the same after that. I kind of fell into a state of not caring and going through life without any real purpose. I simply followed orders and tried to be as incospicuous as possible.
<br><br>
But Grigory needed someone for reserve at Lamentin. Grigory needed me. And I slowly began feeling like living again. He brought me back from my darkest places and now he hauled me even further. He promoted me to lieutenant and gave me my own squad. Stas was helping me the last two days to get a gist of things. Grigory is very busy in the command centre. He's devising strategy to win this war. The enemy is not making it easy, still outnumbering us and continuing to attack our positions. At least there are reinforcements coming in the next few days.
<br><br>
The plot thickens. We will have a talk later when they explain to me some of the stuff behind the scenes. Does Grigory know of the Everon rebels, our fabricated cause of war, the hasty and bloody retreat? Does he suspect a foul play? Is the high command in some sort of a conspiracy or just plain incompetent? Now that I joined the command structure I might finally get some answers.

Welcome to the rank of lieutenant, comrade Rashiv.
<br><br>
In the past few days, enemy infiltration troops have been attacking convoys and units on their way to the front. The roads in question are <a href="marker:ambush1">this one</a> and <a href="marker:ambush2">this one</a>.
<br>
Your objective is to find and destroy the main enemy raiding camp which they set up behind our front lines. Based on the pattern of the attacks we believe the enemy camp is in one of three forests around the area - <a href="marker:Camp1">Gc31</a>, <a href="marker:camp2">Gf35</a> and <a href="marker:camp3">Hd29</a>.
<br><br>
There may be multiple encampments, but your main objective is destroying the largest one. We can mop up the rest later.
<br><br>
Keep in mind your resources are limited as the main bulk of our forces are on the front lines in the south. Try to preserve your units.
<br><br>
You start with comrade Yashin at the <a href="marker:start">headquarters</a> in Saragorod.
