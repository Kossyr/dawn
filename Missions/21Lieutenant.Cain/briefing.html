<b>9th December 1988</b> - I knew Grigory Lemontov was an interesting man the moment I met him. Maybe even the moment I heard of him. Legendary spetsnaz, went through hell and back again, hero of the Soviet Union and even respected by his enemies. A friend to my father. And now a friend to me?
<br><br>
He promoted me to lieutenant and gave me my own squad. Stas was helping me the last two days to get a gist of things. Grigory is very busy in the command centre. He's devising strategy to win this war. The enemy is not making it easy, still outnumbering us and continuing to attack our positions. At least there are reinforcements coming in the next few days.
<br><br>
I always wanted to be like my father before he was killed. Afterwards I kind of fell into a state of not caring. I silently followed orders and tried to be as inconspicuous as possible. But Grigory needed someone for reserve at Lamentin. Grigory needed me. And I slowly began feeling like living again. He brought me back from my darkest places and now he hauled me even further.
<br><br>
Everon was a fiasco and many good men died there. I still remember the naive Ivan Morokov and the strict but loyal Mikhail Dostoevsky. Someone is responsible for that botched operation. Was it even authorized? Why were we told a lie? What was the reason for the attack? What game is being played here?
<br><br>
This is some serious intrigue I'm about to get into, but it is the journey I embarked on. I was there in the first assault on Everon. I was there when Lamentin fell to spetsnaz. I was there during the retreat. I was there with French guerillas and I fought beside them. I was there during the invasion of Kolguyev. I was there when we counterattacked the first time and then the second time as well. Now I am one of the officers and will play an important role in the island's reconquest.
<br><br>
Destiny calls to me and I am poised to answer that call.

Welcome to the rank of lieutenant, comrade Rashiv.
<br><br>
In the past few days, enemy infiltration troops have been attacking convoys and units on their way to the front. The roads in question are <a href="marker:ambush1">this one</a> and <a href="marker:ambush2">this one</a>.
<br>
Your objective is to find and destroy the main enemy raiding camp which they set up behind our frontlines. Based on the pattern of the attacks we believe the enemy camp is in one of three forests around the area - <a href="marker:Camp1">Gc31</a>, <a href="marker:camp2">Gf35</a> and <a href="marker:camp3">Hd29</a>.
<br><br>
There may be multiple encampments, but your main objective is destroying the largest one. We can mop up the rest later.
<br><br>
Keep in mind your resources are limited as the main bulk of our forces are on the frontlines in the south. Try to preserve your units.
<br><br>
You start with comrade Yashin at our <a href="marker:start">headquarters</a> in Saragorod.
