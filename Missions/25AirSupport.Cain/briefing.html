   <b>13th December 1987</b> - Dearest Ekaterina,
    <br><br>
    I hope this letter finds you well. I was hoping to get back to the mainland, but alas, I must break my promise that I have given to return till the end of the year. The army will not let me. There is a war right now - or so we believe. It is not yet official, although surely you must have heard something back in Russia. The NATO and we once again exchange blows like seven years ago.
    <br><br>
    They pushed us to the brink of collapse, but right now it seems we are slowly turning the tide. You do not have to worry - I am still flying the transport helicopters only, although I wish to be assigned to attack squadrons. It is after all my dream and I am close to accomplishing it. I do hope you forgive me my indecency of risking my life while I promised my heart and soul to you. I am sworn to you, my dearest Ekaterina, now and always, and I will come back to you. But not presently.
	<br><br>
	Leaves are on hold until we deal with the enemy  - though I will ask for one as soon as I am able to even if the attack squadron calls me for duty the day before. I will come the moment I can, dearest Ekaterina.
	<br><br>
	I long for your emerald eyes and dazzling smile. I think of you everyday and I ache for your tender touch. This war will not keep us apart for I will not let it. I shall return soon, I promise you that.
	<br><br>
	Forever yours,<br>
	Nikolay

    <p>Good flying and aim, comrade Ablomov. Your skills are wasted in the transport helicopters.</p>
