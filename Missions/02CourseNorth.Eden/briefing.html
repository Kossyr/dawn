<b>2nd November 1988</b> - My first battle. I think I did rather well - it was nothing too crazy though. The enemy was not prepared at all and we quickly pushed through their non-existent defences and seized the village. We certainly did surprise them, but that element quickly wears off - it will be harder and harder from now on.
<br><br>
Command didn't bother letting us rest and now we are headed further north. Our goal is to seize <a href="marker:Provins">Provins</a>, the last village before the city of Montignac. Other squads already took over <a href="marker:Figari">Figari</a> and we are to finish the push. This time we also have tank support.
