   <b>2.11.1986</b> - My first battle. I expected a bloodbath, but it was even worse. Bullets flew all around me, soldiers were dying and I kept thinking about one thing - survive. Which I managed.
<br><br>
 I still don't fully understand what is going on here. Command didn't bother letting us rest and now we are headed further north. Our goal is to seize <a href="marker:provins">Provins</a>, strategically important village. This time we have tank support. 
<br><br>
 The officer said that if this attack was successful, the conflict is all but decided. I don't know about that, from what I have seen the Americans are much better prepared than we are. We only have about a hundred soldiers on the island and a small number of tanks. It seems there's double the Americans at the very least.
<br><br>
Well, if command thinks we can win just in a few days, I won't stop them.
