<b>4th November 1988</b> - it's been a hell of a night. It was dark and the enemy was numerous but we somehow prevailed. Lemontov's sniper rifle was like a loud thunderstorm during a calm night. There were grenade shells, explosions, bullets flying... It was mesmerizing. Adrenaline kept me through all of that and it did not even feel difficult.
<br><br>
I still hadn't slept when Dostoevsky came for me. Lemontov told him good news it seems, since he is very happy with the result. I mean, it is not usual for a private to do this well. Or so I'm told. The knowledge where does my skill come from brings back memories... again. But I feel different now than before. They don't make me weaker anymore... I actually feel stronger...
