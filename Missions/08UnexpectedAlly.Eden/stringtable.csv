STRM_08v01,"Shit! Run, Sergei, run!","",morokov
STRM_08v02,"Damn, we are completely surrounded!","",morokov
STRM_08v03,"Don't move! Hands behind your head!","",am
STRM_08v04,"Hey James, we caught these two nearby. The rest is dead.","",george
STRM_08v05,"Well, well, well, two reds right in front of me.\nGreat work, George!","",james
STRM_08v06,"So my red friends! The time of reversal has come!\nYou started a war of aggression, unprovoked and unjustified and didn't even manage to win with surprise on your side!\nYou have no idea how much I loathe you.","",james
STRM_08v07,"You murdered my mates and friends. You almost fucked up our entire operation...\nBut God has given me the chance for revenge...","",james
STRM_08v08,"We couldn't care less about your shitty friends. We lost them too you know!\nBetter to end this charade and take us to your commanding officers and give us the proper treatment as prisoners of war.","",morokov
STRM_08v09,"What the fuck, James?! Shooting them like ducks could get us in trouble!","",george
STRM_08v10,"I know, it won't happen again! He made me angry so he paid.\nWe already did some crazy shit anyway. Yu didn't suddenly grow a conscience, did you?","",james
STRM_08v11,"Those were few rebel nobodies, who gives a shit about them. But this is getting hot, James.\nWe could face the tribunal for shooting Soviet captives.","",george
STRM_08v12,"If somebody finds out, sure. But they won't. Get yourself together, man, I've got this under control.","",james
STRM_08v13,"You're right. But you should try and get something out of the second one before you kill him.","",george
STRM_08v14,"Hm, anything about Kolguyev would be useful. You're going back?","",james
STRM_08v15,"Yes, we need to push south and get the rest of them. Find me when you're done!","",george
STRM_08v16,"If you're so sure to leave all the fun to me...","",james
STRM_08v17,"Okay, commie, here's the deal. I'll ask a couple of simple questions.\nYou answer quickly and I'll take you as captive.\nYou piss me off and I'll kill you. What do you say?","",james
STRM_08v18,"I say no deal.",".",rashiv
STRM_08v19,"What?","",james
STRM_08v20,"I said no deal. I won't talk.","",rashiv
STRM_08v21,"I offer you a chance to live - just tell me a few things about Kolguyev and you get to return home.","",james
STRM_08v22,"You won't let me live anyway. This theatre of yours ends only in one way - my death.\nBut I'm not going to make it easy for you, I won't say a word.","",rashiv
STRM_08v23,"Okay, mate, you asked for it. I was kind enough to offer you a way out,\nbut if you prefer to die for your fucking red communist union of bullshit, I can readily oblige!","",james
STRM_08v24,"Last chance?","",james
STRM_08v25,"Fine, I count to three.","",james
STRM_08v26,"One...","",james
STRM_08v27,"Two...","",james
STRM_08v28,"Three!","",james
STRM_08v29,"Holy shit! Where did it come from?","",am
STRM_08v30,"You saved my life. I am thankful.","",rashiv
STRM_08v31,"French speaking Soviet, well that is interesting.\nBut save your thanks, commie. We were after the Americans.\nThey were part of a larger group that's especially harsh to our people. They had to pay.","",gaston
STRM_08v32,"Thanks anyway. I am sorry I can't stay long but I have to get to Saint Pierre for the evacuation...","",rashiv
STRM_08v33,"Yes, we know. We'll accompany you. At least you'll help us wreak havoc on the Americans on the way.","",gaston

STRM_08v34,"Alright. Those Americans took all my things, including my radio.\nHave you got any with you by any chance?","",rashiv
STRM_08v35,"There is one in that car. Hey, Jean, did you fix that radio?","",gaston
STRM_08v36,"Of course. It's as good as new.","",poincare
STRM_08v37,"Right. You can use it to contact your command.","",gaston

STRM_08v38,"New evacuation place beyond Levie in the hills. You sure you're coming with?","",rashiv
STRM_08v39,"Of course we are. The Americans will be occupied in the south. It's now or never for you.","",gaston

STRM_08v40,"Here we are. Good luck with whatever it is you'll be doing now.","",gaston
STRM_08v41,"NATO is getting ready to strike at Kolguyev. I think you know pretty well what awaits us...","",rashiv
STRM_08v42,"I can imagine, although that would no longer be our problem. If they go after you they will finally leave their positions here...","",gaston
STRM_08v43,"I am surprised by your hostility. Our officer told us you asked for our help and that's why we attacked Everon...","",rashiv
STRM_08v44,"Load of bullshit, Rashiv. We didn't ask for anyone's help.\nEveron belongs to our people and we do not need NATO or the Soviets to control us.\nAmericans were about ready to give up when you came along...","",gaston
STRM_08v45,"What are you saying? That the cause for war was fabricated? What's even the purpose of this war then?","",rashiv
STRM_08v46,"It's the same as years ago, but this time you will lose even faster.\nGo to your chopper and Kolguyev, Rashiv, and pray you survive the next onslaught.\nIt was close last time, will there be someone to stop it this time?","",gaston
STRM_08v47,"Farewell, Rashiv. I doubt we'll see each other again.","",gaston
STRM_08v48,"Farewell, Gaston.","",rashiv

STRM_08r02,"BAZA TO ANTON. WE HEAR YOU. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? REPORT, OVER.","",baza
STRM_08r03,"OUR CONVOY WAS AMBUSHED NEAR LEVIE. I ALONE SURVIVED. I WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE AMERICANS BUT THE GUERILLA SET ME FREE. I'M CALLING FROM THEIR RADIO AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE TO SAINT PIERRE, OVER.","",rashiv
STRM_08r04,"BAZA TO ANTON YOU SAID YOU ALONE SURVIVED? CAN YOU CONFIRM THE DEATH OF LIEUTENANT DOSTOEVSKY? OVER.","",baza

STRM_08r11,"THAT'S LEVIE, RIGHT OVER THAT HILL. RASHIV, CAN YOU GO AND HAVE A QUICK LOOK? SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. CHECK OUT WHAT'S LEFT IN THE VILLAGE AND GET RIGHT BACK.","",gaston

STRM_08r12,"WHAT DO YOU SEE, RASHIV?","",gaston
STRM_08r13,"I SEE ONE ENEMY SQUAD PLUS FEW PATROLS. THERE'S ALSO A TRUCK.","",rashiv
STRM_08r14,"EXCELLENT, A TRUCK WOULD BE USEFUL. THERE'S NOT MANY OF THEM. LET'S ATTACK. ALL WITH ME!","",gaston

STRM_08r15,"GOOD WORK, MEN. GET INTO THAT CAR AND LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.","",gaston

STRM_08r16,"DAMN IT RASHIV, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SNEAKY! GET UP BOYS, WE'RE GOING IN!","",gaston

STRM_08r17,"WE GET OUT HERE AND CONTINUE ON FOOT. WE DON'T WANT TO LEAD THEM STRAIGHT TO THE EVACUATION PLACE.","",gaston
