   <b>15.12.1986</b> - Afghanistan was a mess. I was sent there after after Leningrad, after the meeting with Volkov. Although I was no longer colonel, the soldiers paid their respects to me well enough. Even officers asked on multiple occasions for my advice and I even led few operations myself. I was assigned a group of Spetsnaz. 
   <br><br>
   Most of them came with me from Leningrad, but some of them I met there, among them Kaplinsky. I wasn't there to meet any friends, but lack of Stas was dawning on me. I wasn't among enemies but neither was I among friends. The Spetsnaz were Kaplinsky's clone almost - silent and obedient. I remember Kaplinsky the most because he was my second in command and he does have a nice shot with a sniper rifle. All in all it was cold out there even though the weather was hot. I felt like I was being watched, measured somehow. I learned in Afghanistan to not trust my fellow comrades and believe only in myself. I had a different thoughts when it came to USSR than others and I knew my thoughts could very well send me to gulag or straight to the firing squad.
   <br><br>
   My comrades aside, the was was going slowly. The rebels were hiding high up in the mountains and we had a hard time smoking them out. Our convoys kept getting intercepted and our ground patrols ambushed. We worked mostly during the night but we didn;t get that much done either. The Afghan rebels knew well where to hide and we had only a limited success. It was a good training for me at the very least, much better than Leningrad. I was back in the field and it made my blood flow again. 
   <br><br>
   Once after a long night we were called to the command tent. Our group was reassigned to Kolguyev. At the time I thought we were going back to the training camps. The thought of going back after such a short while made me uneasy - it was like returning to the scene of the crime. 
   <br><br>
   When we finally arrived on Kolguyev at the beginning of November and were sent on the first chopper to Everon - that's when I realized that everything was about to go haywire.

	We took most of central Kolguyev but the hilly and mountainous areas are still under enemy control. We have to strike before the enemy fortifies his positions - this very night. We do not posses enough night equipment to mount a full scale attack, thus it falls mainly to Spetsnaz to lead the charge. Mechanized squad Ivan will support your effort as they are equipped with night vission goggles.
	<br>
	In a few moments, squad Ivan will arrive at our <a href="marker:Ivan">base</a> and will be waiting for your orders. The first phase has two objectives - a small checkpoint at <a href="marker:Crossroads">crossroads</a> and a guarded <a href="marker:Camp">camp</a>. Call in Ivan to support your attack.
	<br><br>
	Second phase is seizing the important <a href="marker:MountainTop">mountain top</a>. We do know the enemy has AA gun stationed there - destroy it so we can send in the airborne units. Take a rocket launcher with you so you can take it out as fast as possible, then clear the area of enemy units.
	<br><br>
	You start at our <a href="marker:Start">base</a>.
