   <b>10th December 1987</b> - Reinforcements are finally slowly arriving, but the enemy does not sleep. He's going to try one last major attack before we can fully reorganize.
   <br><br>
   We are defending three fronts - <a href="marker:WesternFront">western</a>,  <a href="marker:CentralFront">central</a> and  <a href="marker:EasternFront">eastern</a>. Strategic positions are fortified and each incoming road from the south has mines placed on it. I must remember we are outnumbered - so we'll have to be careful. Enemy push in the centre should be the least dangerous but still respectable. Probably few APCs and a lot of infantry.
   <br><br>
   I've been given command not only of a single squad, but the entire defence of central front. I need to stay focused and not leave designed positions. I should also make sure my squad is geared up before we board the helicopter to the front lines.

	The enemy is conducting a major offensive along the entire front to try and make a breakthrough before our reinforcements fully reinforce our army. This must not happen.
	<br><br>
	You are in charge of the <a href="marker:CentralFront">central front</a>. Hold your position against enemy attacks. We are outnumbered - make use of fortifications and the defensive terrain.
	<br><br>
	You start at the <a href="marker:start">heliport</a>.

    <p>We have successfully held the enemy back and are now in prime position to launch counterattack and reconquer the island.</p>

    <br>
    <p>You didn't manage to hold the central front. Its collapse led to the enemy encircling our other fronts and to de facto winning the battle for Kolguyev.</p>
