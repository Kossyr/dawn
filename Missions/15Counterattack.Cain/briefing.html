<b>2nd December 1988</b> - Two days ago we destroyed a good chunk of enemy armour. NATO didn't delay their attack as expected, but proceeded to continue their offensive. At first they went mainly along the coast, but now they're coming to central Kolguyev as well.
<br><br>
In theory, we should have the advantage as the tanks are not as useful here and the rough terrain favors the defender. The enemy crossed the hills and the mountains and right now threatens one of our last bases in central Kolguyev. We are sent to support this base.
<br><br>
I've talked with Lemontov this morning. He said he knew my father and that we were alike. I am glad for that - legacy of my father is partly what keeps me going. I hope he would be proud to see me filling his shoes. It feels like the war he started I might be able to finish.
<br><br>
I feel we're growing closer, me and Lemontov. I may be able to get more information on my father in the future - including the moment he died. I've never met anyone who was with him during the American assault - I would like to hear what truly happened and not the dry official version of "died defending retreating units". I have a feeling Lemontov might have been there that day.

The invasion of our island is under way. The enemy has pushed us out of the south and now advances north. We must stop this advance at all costs.
