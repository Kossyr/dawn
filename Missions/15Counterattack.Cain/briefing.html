   <b>2.12.1986</b> - Two days ago we destroyed a good chunk of enemy armour. NATO didn't delay their attack as expected, but proceeded to continue their offensive. At first they went mainly along the coast, but now they're coming to central Kolguyev as well.
<br><br>
In theory, we should have the advantage as the tanks are not as useful here and the rough terrain favors the defender. Despite that the enemy crossed the hills and the mountain and right now threatens one of our last bases in central Kolguyev. We are sent to support this base.
<br><br>
I've talked with Lemontov this morning. He said he knew my father and that we were alike. I was glad to hear those words, but I needed to know how my father died. I've never met anyone who was with him on that day of the American assault - I never believed there were no witnesses to that - did none from his squad survive? And why did Lemontov dodge the question? 
<br><br>
I'll have to pressure him more - I think I don't risk anything by doing that. He is quite fond of me. And he's not like some other officers. I looked him in the eyes and I saw myself - there is great pain in him that he doesn't show but carries inside. Did he lose someone as well? I've never even heard if he had any family - and the last seven years he spent in an American prison.
<br><br>
What's going inside that head of his? What are his thoughts? Does he think the same as me? Does he... doubt?
