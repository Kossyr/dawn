STRM_f01v01,"You can go!","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v02,"Go, Soviet!","",American negotiator
STRM_f01v03,"We're done here. Let's go!","",American negotiator

STRM_f01v04,"Welcome back to the Soviet Union, comrade Grigory Lemontov. You have been kept from your home country for far too long.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v05,"Your unlawful imprisonment by the capitalists of the west has finally come to an end.\nWe are honoured to be able to welcome you back.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v06,"Three cheers for the return of Grigory Lemontov to his motherland!","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v07,"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!","",Everyone
STRM_f01v08,"It's... good to be back, comrades. Thank you.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v09,"Long live comrade Lemontov! Hurrah!","",Everyone
STRM_f01v10,"If you would, please, follow me to my car, comrade. I'll take you to your tent.","",Shaposhnikov

STRM_f01v11,"Welcome back, comrade Lemontov. My name is Stanislav Shaposhnikov and I was responsible for the exchange.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v12,"Those three were western spies captured in Moscow. We reached a deal wherein you would be exchanged for them.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v13,"Where are we going?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v14,"To Severovodsk. You'll have your accommodations there.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v15,"Back there, it felt like you were welcoming a hero.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v16,"But we were, weren't we? To those that remember you, you are a great commander. To those new, you are a legend.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v17,"Hm, I don't feel like either. Isn't that Arzapol? Did nobody bother to repair any of the destroyed buildings?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v18,"We never received the budget. And honestly, it reminds men of our defeat and motivates them to get better.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v19,"I was gone for seven years and Kolguyev still looks exactly the same.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v20,"The island itself has not changed. Other things have. You'll see that soon enough for yourself.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v21,"Stanislav Shaposhnikov... the name rings a bell, we must have met. Were you under Livanokh?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v22,"You could say that. I was under Rashiv.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v23,"Vadim Rashiv? Wait, I remember you...","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v24,"Comrade Lemontov, let us not discuss it here. We shall talk in Severovodsk.","",Shaposhnikov

STRM_f01v25,"We're here. Follow me.","",Shaposhnikov

STRM_f01v26,"This tent has been assigned to you. Mine is just around the corner. We can talk freely here.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v27,"I rememeber you. How did you survive?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v28a,"Those blokes you left me with wanted to hang me from a tree.\nBefore they could agree on which one, an American commando showed up and captured us.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v28b,"I spent the rest of the war imprisoned.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v29,"The fate of my comrades and Rashiv I only learned later. Nobody else from my group survived.\nYou made sure of that.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v30,"Trust me, not a day goes by that I don't regret what I did.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v31,"Remorse is a common feeling for those sentenced behind bars. It does not wash away your guilt, however.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v32,"I'm not asking for forgiveness. At the time, I did what I perceived as right, as necessary for the better of my country, my people.\nI was wrong, but I can't take it back.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v33,"I won't judge you for your past actions, I leave that to God. I already came to terms with what occurred.\nIt is nothing we can change, unlike the future.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v34,"After the war I learned about the Americans raiding the villa and capturing you while killing Livanokh.\nThat's the official version of events.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v35,"Most people don't have a reason not to believe it, but I'm not among them.\nI met with George Dyaconsen and he was not the kind of man to shoot first and ask questions later.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v36,"What are you implying?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v37,"You were Livanokh's loyal dog.\nIf there was a fatality during the raid, it would have been you, as you would defend him to the last breath, am I not right?","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v38,"Spit it out. What do you think happened?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v39,"Do you really wish me to say it aloud? I think you killed Livanokh.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v40,"And if I did, what does it make me?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v41,"A hero, of course. That's what I would tell you. Livanokh had to be stopped.\nIf you ever wondered whether you've done the right thing, you have.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v42,"Unfortunately, that is not the generally accepted opinion among our comrades.\nYou should know that the Army general in charge of Kolguyev is Vladimir Volkov.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v43,"I remember him. A low ranking officer, dutiful and efficient.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v44,"Well, he climbed high and now controls Kolguyev and wields substantial political influence.\nNot enough to cause trouble yet, but enough to be of concern.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v45,"What is his plan?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v46,"I'm not sure, I only know he is still loyal to Livanokh and what was he trying to achieve. He might be continuing in his legacy.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v47,"I did not stop one madman to let another finish his job. Does he possess nuclear weapons?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v48,"Not yet, thank god. But you do know the significance of Malden and what could that mean.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v49,"Does he wish to invade?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v50,"I don't know. It seems like it, as we are concentrating more and more forces on Kolguyev. Slowly still, but surely.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v51,"What's the situation back home?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v52a,"Not good. A general political instability and corruption, seceding states, economic recession, the whole mess that is Afghanistan...","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v52b,"It's much different than what you remember.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v53,"This does sound serious. Can I count on you?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v54,"It is strange to hear you say that, Lemontov, but yes. I'll never forget what you did to Rashiv, but this is what he was fighting against.\nHe would want us to finish the fight.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v55a,"Good, thank you. First and foremost, I need information. I have seven year long window I need to fill.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v55b,"I also need to meet the local commanders and get to know them to get a bigger picture of the situation.","",Lemonmtov
STRM_f01v56,"Yes, you're right. Volkov is coming in tomorrow and will want to see you.\nHe ordered a uniform to be made for you, so it seems he wants you back in the army.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v57,"Then I am safe as long as I keep the truth secret. It might come out one day, so I must be ready for that.\nUntil then, we can work with the time we have.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v58,"What do you think would happen were they to find out?","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v59,"Not sure, but if Volkov's anything like my old self, I'll get probably shot without much parade. It's better not to test it.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v60,"Absolutely. Now, let's see... there are five important people you should meet.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v61a,"First, you need to meet Zubarev, the commander-in-chief. He is in charge when Volkov is not here.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v61b,"He is more of a politician than a soldier and I have my doubts about his military capabilities, but he's very close to Volkov.\nBe mindful around him.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v62,"Second, there's Kaplinsky, the commander of spetsnaz. You'll probably have to spend a lot of time with him very soon.\nI don't know much about him.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v63,"Third, Frolov, the tank commander, you are already familiar with him. He hasn't changed much since your time.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v64a,"Fourth, the newcomer, Syomin. From what I've heard, a brilliant ace pilot and the commander of the air force.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v64b,"Apparently, he has a family history of piloting. Don't let him start talking about that, you'll never hear the end of it.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v65,"Fifth, the logistics officer, Chernikov. He can be hard to find, just keep looking. He is in charge of all supplies.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v66,"Additionally, If you wish to hear more about the events you missed, I can recommend two other people.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v67a,"For domestic politics and the general world affairs, you can go to the postmaster, Boris Belsky.\nEvery piece of paper, fax or telegram goes through him.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v67b,"He is also able to get his hands on some foreign journals,\nso he knows a lot about the wider world.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v68a,"Concerning the archipelago, you should go to Maksim Kuznetsov. Supposedly, he's been here from the very beginning.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v68b,"He's from logistics and knows everyone in the army. A good man to meet regardless.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v69,"You can take my car if you wish. Once you are done, get back to me. I'll be in my tent waiting for you.","",Shaposhnikov
STRM_f01v70,"Alright, see you later.","",Lemontov

-- Zubarev - Introduction
STRM_f01v71,"Grigory Lemontov in the flesh. I almost didn't believe it when they said you'd be coming back.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v72,"Comrade Zubarev I presume?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v73,"You presume right. You should know I was against the exchange. We lost three valuable spies.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v74,"It's one way to look at it.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v75a,"I don't really see any benefit you are supposed to bring us.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v75b,"I suppose, while you're here, you could at the very least tell me about Livanokh.\nYou were there with him during the final moments, weren't you?","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v76,"I would rather tell that personally to comrade Volkov, when he arrives.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v77,"Yes, of course, he should be the first to know. Tell me about the prison then.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v78,"It was long and solitary. Nothing of any interest.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v79,"What about the enemy? Any information or news?","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v80,"No.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v81,"You haven't seen anything or heard anything?","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v82,"Comrade Zubarev, I was in prison.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v83,"Yes, I see. Never mind. Have you talked with Kaplinsky yet?","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v84,"I have.","",Lemontov - Y
STRM_f01v85,"Good, then you know you shall be leading spetsnaz again.","",Zubarev - Y
STRM_f01v86,"It didn't sound like I was given a choice.","",Lemontov - Y
STRM_f01v87,"What would you possibly do instead? Get back to the mainland to lead a civil life?","",Zubarev - Y
STRM_f01v88,"Not yet.","",Lemontov - N
STRM_f01v89,"You should. He has information regarding your future in the army.","",Zubarev - N
STRM_f01v90,"Do you mean I cannot just pack my things and go back to the mainland to lead a civil life?","",Lemontov - N
STRM_f01v91,"Don't be ridiculous. I've read your files. You've been soldier your whole life.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v92,"Don't you feel any resentment to the Americans?\nThey killed your brother Livanokh before your eyes. Or did the prison time break your will?","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v93,"It's been ten years since I've been back in Russia, comrade Zubarev. That is all.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v94,"You shall return, comrade Lemontov, do not worry about that.\nBut there is still work to be done before that can happen.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v95,"That's something we can agree on.","",Lemontov
-- Zubarev - Zinovy Zubarev
STRM_f01v96,"Can you tell me something about yourself?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v97,"Zubarev is a name you should be familiar with.\nI come from a family with a long military tradition.\nOne of my forefathers commanded a batallion on the right wing in the battle of Borodino, during Napoleonic wars.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v98,"Impressive.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v99,"During the revolution, my grandfather helped comrade Stalin in the capture of Tsaritsyn.\nHe was commended for his actions by comrade Stalin himself. As you can see, military is my second nature.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v100,"What is the first?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v101,"I am well versed in politics.\nI am the second advisor to the Minister of Defence. I offer counsel on other matters as well.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v102,"I have to travel a lot between Kolguyev and Moscow to fulfill my many duties,\nbut that is the fate of those skilled and needed.","",Zubarev
-- Zubarev - Land forces
STRM_f01v103,"What's the army situation like?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v104,"The peace treaty forbids us to station too many men on the island.\nWe do what we can with the little we have.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v105,"Our office corps is experienced and we have many new recruits.\nKolguyev serves as a training centre at the moment more than a garrison.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v106,"Our other duty is to monitor the situation in the archipelago.\nAfter all, we are the closest military personnel to the enemy after the city of Berlin.\nAny information we can gather is invaluable back home.","",Zubarev
-- Zubarev - Exit conversation
STRM_f01v107,"Interesting discussion, comrade. I'll be heading out.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v108,"Go, we'll be seeing each other plenty of times.\nAnd maybe once you get back into shape you might become useful.","",Zubarev
STRM_f01v109,"I can't wait to work with you, comrade Zubarev. Goodbye.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v110,"I'll be watching you, Lemontov.","",Zubarev
-- Zubarev -- Re-enter
STRM_f01v111,"What is it, comrade?","",Zubarev

-- Syomin - Introduction
STRM_f01v112,"Comrade Grigory Lemontov, it is very good to finally meet you.\nWe never had the pleasure - Valentin Syomin, commander of the air force.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v113,"We had not. The pleasure is all mine.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v114,"Your imprisonment was very unfortunate. I've heard of your deeds and I am glad you are able to join us again.\nHow is your health?","",Syomin
STRM_f01v115,"It was boring and solitary, comrade Syomin, but I wasn't tortured.\nI am as healthy as one can be.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v116,"No food deprivation, beatings or waterboarding?","",Syomin
STRM_f01v117,"None. What exactly do you think I went through?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v118a,"One hears things. And given your history with the Americans, I expected them to want to get back at you.\nIt's good to hear that's not the case.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v118b,"Are you going to stay with us or are you returning to the mainland?","",Syomin
STRM_f01v119,"I feel like it is expected of me to stay.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v120,"Hm, the duty to the motherland - a curse and a privilege at the same time. I know what you mean.\nThen I am glad we shall have more opportunities to meet.","",Syomin
-- Syomin - Valentin Syomin
STRM_f01v121,"I've heard you arrived recently.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v122,"Three months ago, in fact. I used to serve in Europe and Afghanistan.\nI was reassigned here to command the local air force when the previous commander retired.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v123a,"I've flown in everything - helicopters, gunships, jets, gliders, even a hot balloon on one occasion.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v123b,"Flying is in my blood passed through generations of pilots.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v124,"Do you perhaps wish to hear about my family history?","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v125,"Why not.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v126,"Alright, sit down if you can, this is a long and epic tale about the Syomin pilot family.\nIt all started back in Imperial Russia, at the beginning of the century.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v127,"The aviation industry was just getting started. There was no air force to speak of just yet.\nScientists and engineers were developing some of the first aircraft designs.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v128,"It wasn't only planes at this point, but also aerostats, either airships or hot baloons.\nYou see, it had to start somewhere.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v129,"We were actually first in the aviation field to establish an aerodynamic institute.\nMy great-grandfather Nikita Syomin joined it and became an officer.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v130a,"He was part of a scheme where several members of the office corps of the institute were sent to France to train on their aeroplanes.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v130b,"He gained much needed experience and even found love - Marie Saugner-Syomin, my great-gradmother.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v131,"They eventually returned to Russia together and started a family.","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v132,"At the outset of World War I, air force was strictly used for reconnaissance and coordination of artillery fire.\nLater, they were rearmed with steel flachettes and air-dropped bombs to attack ground targets.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v133a,"You can imagine the effectiveness of those weapons.\nAfter some time, machine guns replaced them, which also enabled the aeroplanes to fight each other.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v133b,"Nikita was never shot down, although he came close once, but managed to land successfully.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v134a,"Nikita became an ace pilot and received the Order of the White Eagle and few other medals.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v134b,"I still have them at my home, along with the other decorations and awards of my other family members.\nIf we ever get the chance, I can show you, if you'd like.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v135,"I already added a few to the collection myself.\nThe most successful is my grandfather, who fought in the Patriotic war.\nHe shot down the most enemy aircraft - incredible forty-seven!","",Syomin
STRM_f01v136,"But I digress, first there was the civil war.","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v137,"The civil war is a somewhat dark passage in our family books - you see, Nikita actually fought for the Whites.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v138,"The war was bloody and hard. There was no joy in it, as Nikita used to say.\nIt was brother against brother. He was forced to shoot down many of his former colleagues and friends.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v139a,"When it was finally over and the Whites lost, Nikita was pardoned. Possibly for his great skill and fame.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v139b,"He left the army soon afterwards - he was unable to continue serving after such a horrendous war.\nIn his eyes, service lost meaning.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v140,"Now it is finally time for the greatest pilot in Syomin history, my grandfather, Aleksandr Syomin!","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v141,"It was during the Great Patriotic War.\nAt the beginning, most of our aircraft got destroyed before they had a chance to take off.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v142a,"Whatever was left was crambled and used to defend Moscow. Aleksandr flew air missions day and night, with little sleep and rest.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v142b,"When the enemy finally retreated, he told me he slept for three days straight to recover!","",Syomin
STRM_f01v143a,"Aleksandr was flying the famous Lavochkin La-5 model.\nIt was an incredible aeroplane.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v143b,"With its revolutionary air-cooled engine and two cannons,\nit was powerful enough to challenge even the feared German Messerschmitt.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v144,"Aleksandr flew many sorties during the war and shot down by official accounts forty-seven enemy aircraft,\nthe most in our family history as well as sixth in total in all the Soviet Union.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v145a,"He was made the Hero of the Soviet Union and received many medals.\nI added them at the lower shelf in our collection, right below my great-grandfather.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v145b,"Each family generation has its own shelf, mine is the lowest.","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v146a,"My father and your namesake, Grigory Syomin, was more of an engineer than a pilot.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v146b,"He worked in Mil - the aerospace manufacturer - and helped design and create most of their models.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v147,"He was also part of every test flight, so that still makes him parially pilot in my eyes.\nI am very proud of him, every time I fly in Mil model, I always think of him.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v148,"And not only him, actually.\nWhen I'm piloting, hundreds of meters above the ground, in a fight with enemy gunship, I remember all my forefathers.\nI'd like to think I'm making them proud.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v149a,"So, there you have it,\nI told you about Nikita, the first pilot, Aleksandr, the best pilot, Grigory, the designer pilot, and Valentin, yours truly, the young pilot.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v149b,"Thank you for listening to my family story, it's been a while since I told it to someone.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v150,"The pleasure is all mine.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v151,"You are very kind, comrade Lemontov. I knew I'd like you.","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v152,"I'm sorry, perhaps another time?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v153,"No problem, comrade Lemontov.","",Syomin
--
STRM_f01v154,"I'm sorry, comrade Syomin, but can we get to other topics as well?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v155,"Of course, of course, we can return to this some other time.\nWhat else would you like to know about?","",Syomin
-- Syomin - Air forces
STRM_f01v156,"What can you tell me about the air force?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v157a,"I command only handful of helicopters at the moment.\nTwo transport helicopters Mi-17 and one attack helicopter Mi-24.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v157b,"I asked for at least one gunship in case of an emergency, but my request was denied.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v158a,"There is a new design in the works, my father showed me.\nKamov V-80, I've only been able to see the blueprints, but it looks like it could rival the very best aircraft of the west.","",Syomin
STRM_f01v158b,"I can't wait to get my hands on that, the production allegedly already started.","",Syomin
-- Syomin - Exit conversation
STRM_f01v159,"Thank you, comrade Syomin, it was nice talking to you. See you later.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v160,"I should be the one thanking, comrade Lemontov, for being such a keen listener. I'm glad you are back. Goodbye!","",Syomin - A
STRM_f01v161,"Likewise, comrade Lemontov. Goodbye!","",Syomin - B
-- Syomin -- Re-enter
STRM_f01v162,"Comrade Lemontov, do you wish to hear my family story again?","",Syomin - A
STRM_f01v163,"Is there something you wanted, comrade Lemontov?","",Syomin - B

-- Frolov - Introduction
STRM_f01v164,"If my eyes do not deceive me, I see comrade Lemontov. It's good to have you back, comrade.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v165,"Comrade Frolov, long time no see. How are you?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v166,"The same old, same old.\nI am still the commander of our armoured forces, though there are not really any forces to speak of.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v167,"I long for the old days. We waged a hard war, but it carried meaning.\nIt felt like we were achieving something, something nobody dared before us.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v168,"What happened with you after I was captured?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v169,"I was with comrade Volkov. We retreated with him to the mainland. Not everyone was so lucky, though.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v170,"When we got the island back, I returned here.\nNowadays, I hardly ever go back to the mainland. I like it here.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v171,"It's calm and quiet most of the time, though the weather got even more cold, if you can believe it!\nBut I am not giving up my sunglasses!","",Frolov
STRM_f01v172,"Because they bring you luck.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v173,"Your memory has no equal, Lemontov!","",Frolov
-- Frolov - Bogdan Frolov
STRM_f01v174,"You said you don't go back home anymore?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v175,"Aye, I don't really have a reason to. My wife died five years ago. Cancer.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v176,"I'm sorry for your loss.","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v177,"We lived separately the last few years, but it still hurt.\nWithout her, there is no reason to go back.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v178,"The last time I was in Russia, it was at her funeral. I never looked back ever since.","",Frolov
-- Frolov - Tank forces
STRM_f01v179,"What's the current situation with the tanks?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v180,"We have hardly any, that's the main issue. Very little heavy tanks and modest amount of light tanks and transports.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v181,"We are able to support infantry to a limited extent, but in a tank battle we would not stand a chance.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v182,"We have been getting more stuff in lately, though we are still far away from a battle ready state.","",Frolov
STRM_f01v183,"What is the main tank model?","",Lemontov
STRM_f01v184,"Still the good old T80 with slight modifications. There is no new design in the works anyway.\nYou can't improve what is already perfect.","",Frolov

STRM_f01v203,"I am proficient with rifles, small arms and most kinds of pistols.\nI am not bad with a sniper rifle, though I prefer to be a spotter.","",Kaplinsky
STRM_f01v204,"I can keep my breath underwater for eight minutes and forty seconds.\nIt actually saved my life back in Afghanistan.","",Kaplinsky
STRM_f01v205,"Our convoy was ambushed once.\nI was looking for survivors, but I could not find anyone still alive.","",Kaplinsky
STRM_f01v206,"Suddenly, a large enemy patrol came upon me.\nI only had time to dash into a nearby bog and hide under the mud.","",Kaplinsky
