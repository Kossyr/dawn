Welcome back, comrade Lemontov. My name is Stanislav Shaposhnikov and I was responsible for the exchange.
Those three were western spies captured in Moscow. We reached a deal wherein you would be exchanged for them.
Where are we going?
To Severovodsk. You'll have your accommodations there.
Back there, it felt like you were welcoming a hero.
But we were, were't we? To those that remember you, you are a great commander. To those new, you are a legend.
Hm, I don't feel like either. Is that Arzapol we're driving through? Did nobody bother to repair any of the destroyed buildings?
We never received the budget. And honestly, it reminds men of our defeat and motivates them to get better.
I was gone for seven years and Kolguyev still looks exactly the same.
The island itself has not changed. Other things have. You'll see that soon enough for yourself.
Stanislav Shaposhnikov... the name rings a bell, we must have met. Were you under Livanokh?
You could say that. I was under Rashiv.
Vadim Rashiv? Wait, I remember you...
Comrade Lemontov, let us not discuss it here. We shall talk in Severovodsk.

We're here. Follow me.

-- Shaposhnikov Discussion

This tent has been assigned to you. Mine is just around the corner. We can talk freely here.
Stanislav Shaposhnikov, I remember. How did you survive?
Those blokes you left me with wanted to hang me from a tree. Before they could agree on which one, an American commando showed up and captured us. I spent the rest of the war imprisoned.
The fate of my comrades and Rashiv I only learned later. Nobody else from my group survived. You made sure of that.
Trust me, not a day goes by when I don't regret what I did.
Remorse is a common feeling for those sentenced behind bars. It does not wash away your guilt, however. 
I'm not asking for forgiveness. At the time, I did what I perceived as right, as necessary for the better of my country, my people. I was wrong but I can't take it back.
I won't judge you for your past actions, I leave that to God. I already came to terms with what occured. It is nothing we can change, unlike the future.
After the war I learned about you and Livanokh. How the Americans raided the villa and captured you while killing Livanokh. That's the official version of events.
Most people don't have a rason not to believe it, but I'm not among them. I met with George Dyaconsen and he was not the kind of man to shoot first and ask questions later.
What are you implying?
You were Livanokh's loyal dog. If there was a fatality during the raid, it would have been you, as you would defend him to the last breath, am I not right?
Spit it out then. What do you think happened?
Do you really wish me to say it aloud? I think you killed Livanokh.
And if I did, what does it make me?
A hero, of course. That's what I would tell you. Livanokh had to be stopped. If you ever wondered whether you've done the right thing, you have.
Unfortunately, that is not the generally accepted opinion among our comrades. You should know that the Army general in charge of Kolguyev is Vladimir Volkov.
I remember him. A low lanking officer, loyal and smart.
Well, he climbed high and now controls considerable armies and wields substantial political influence. Not enough to cause trouble yet, but enough to be of concern.
What is his plan?
I'm not sure, I only know he is still loyal to Livanokh and what was he trying to achieve. He might be continuing in his legacy.
I did not stop one madman to let another finish his job. Does he possess nuclear weapons?
Not yet, thank god. But you do know the significance of Malden and what could that mean.
Does he wish to invade it?
I don't know. It seems like it, as we are concentrating more and more forces on Kolguyev. Slowly still, but surely.
What's the situation back at home?
Not good. A general political instability, seceding states, army mutinies, the whole mess that is Afghanistan... It's much different than what you remember.
This does sound serious. Can I count on you?
It is strange to hear you say that, Lemontov, but yes. I'll never forget Rashiv, but his is what he was fighting against. He would want us to finish the fight.
Good, thank you, Stanislav. First and foremost, I need information. I have seven year long window I need to fill. I also need to meet the local commanders and get to know them to get a bigger picture of the situation.
Yes, you're right. Volkov is coming in tomorrow so we have time until then. He also ordered a uniform to be made for you, so he wants you back in the army. As long as he doesn't know the whole truth, he does not have a reason to go after you. 
We keep the truth for ourselves.
Absolutely. Now, let's see... there are five important people you should meet.
First, you need to meet Zubarev, the commander-in-chief. He is in charge when Volkov is not here. He is more of a politic than a soldier and I have my doubts about his capabilities, but he's very close to Volkov. Be careful around him.
Second, there's Kaplinsky, the commander of Spetsnaz. You'll probably have to spend a lot of time with him very soon. I don't know much about him.
Third, Frolov, the tank commander, you are already familiar with him. He hasn't changed much since your time.
Fourth, the newcomer, Syomin. From what I've heard, a brilliant ace pilot and the commander of the air force. Apparently, he has a family history of piloting. Don't let him start talking about that, you'll never hear the end of it.
Lastly, the logistics officer, Chernikov. Sometimes, he's hard to find, just keep looking. He is in charge of all supplies.
Additionally, If you wish to hear more about the events you missed, I can recommend two other people.
For domestic politics and the general world affairs, you can go to the postmaster, Boris Belsky. Every piece of paper, fax or telegram goes through him. He is also able to get his hands on some foreign journals, so he knows a lot about the wider world.
Concerning the archipelago, you should go to Maksim Kuznetsov. Supposedly, he's been here from the very beginning. He's from logistics and knows everyone in the army. A good man to meet regardless. 
You can take my car if you wish. Once you are done, get back to me. I'll be in my tent waiting for you.
See you then.

-- Zubarev - Introduction
Grigory Lemontov in the flesh. I almost didn't believe it when they said you'd be coming back.
Comrade Zubarev, I presume.
You presume right. You should know I was against the exchange. We lost three valuable spies.
It's one way to look at it.
I don't really see any benefit you are supposed to bring us. While you're here, you could at the very least tell me about Livanokh. You were there with him during the final moments, weren't you?
I would rather tell that personally to comrade Volkov, when he arrives.
Yes, of course, he should be the first to know. Tell me about the prison then.
It was long and solitary. Nothing of any interest.
What about the enemy? Any information or news?
No.
You haven't seen anything or heard anything?
Comrade Zubarev, I was in prison.
Yes, I see. Never mind. Have you talked with Kaplinsky yet?
Y - I have.
Y - Good, then you know you shall be leading Spetsnaz again.
Y - It didn't sound like I was given a choice.
Y - What would you possibly do instead? Get back to the mainland to lead a civil life?
N - Not yet.
N - You should. He has information regarding your future in the army.
N - Do you mean I cannot just pack my things and go back to the mainland to lead a civil life?
Don't be ridiculous. I've read your files. You've been soldier your whole life. You wouldn't abandon the army now when it most needs you.
Don't you feel any resentment to the Americans? They killed your brother Livanokh before your eyes. Or did the prison time break your will?
It's been ten years since I've been back in Russia, comrade Zubarev. That is all.
You shall return, comrade Lemontov, do not worry about that. But there is still work to be done before that can happen. 
That's something we can agree on.
-- Zubarev - Zinovy Zubarev
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Zubarev is a name you should be familiar with. I come from a family with a long military tradition. One of my forefathers commanded a batallion on the right wing in the battle of Borodino, during Napoleonic wars.
Impressive.
During the revolution, my grandfather helped comrade Stalin in the capture of Tsaritsyn. He was commended for his actions by comrade Stalin himself. As you can see, military is my second nature.
What is the first?
I am well versed in politics. I am the second advisor to the Minister of Defence. I offer counsel on other matters as well. I have to go back to back between Kolguyev and Moscow to fulfill my many duties, but that is the fate of those skilled and needed.
-- Zubarev - Land forces
What's the army situation like?
The peace treaty forbids us to station too many men on the island. We do what we can with the little we have.
Our office corps is experienced and we have many new recruits. Kolguyev serves as a training centre at the moment more than a garrison.
Our other duty is to monitor the situation in the archipelago. After all, we are the closest military personnel to the enemy after the city of Berlin. Any information we can gather is invaluable back home.
-- Zubarev - Exit conversation
Interesting discussion, comrade Zubarev. I'll be heading out.
Go, we'll be seeing each other plenty of times. Maybe once you get back to shape you might become useful.
I can't wait to work with you, comrade Zubarev. Goodbye.
I'll be watching you, Lemontov.

-- Syomin - Introduction
Comrade Grigory Lemontov, it is very good to finally meet you. We never had the pleasure - Valentin Syomin, commander of the air force.
We had not. The pleasure is all mine.
Your imprisonment was very unfortunate. I've heard of your deeds and I am glad you are able to join us again. How is your health?
It was boring and solitary, comrade Syomin, but I wasn't tortured. I am as healthy as one can be.
No food deprivation, beatings or waterboarding?
None. What exactly do you think I went through?
One hears things. And given your history with the Americans, I expected them to want to get back at you. It's good to hear that's not the case. Are you going to stay with us or are you returning to the mainland?
I feel like it is expected of me to stay.
Hm, the duty to the motherland - a curse and a privilege at the same time. I know what you mean. Then I am glad we shall have more opportunities to meet.
-- Syomin - Valentin Syomin
I've heard you arrived recently.
Three months ago, in fact. I used to serve in Europe and Afghanistan. I was reassigned here to command the local air force when the previous commander retired.
I've flown in everything - helicopters, gunships, jets, even an airliner on one occassion. Flying is in my blood passed through generations of pilots. Do you wish to hear about our family history?
--
Why not.
Alright, sit down if you can, this is a long and epic story about the Syomin pilot family. It all started back in Imperial Russia, at the beggining of the century.
The aviation industry was just getting started. There was no air force to speak of just yet. Scientists and engineers were developing some of the first aircraft designs.
It wasn't only planes at this point, but also aerostats, either airships or hot baloons. You see, it had to start somewhere. 
We were actually first in the aviation field to establish an aerodynamic institute. My great-grandfather Nikita Syomin joined it and became an officer.
He was part of a scheme where several members of the office corps of the institute were sent to France to train on their aeroplanes. He gained much needed experience and even found love - Marie Saugner-Syomin, my great-gradmother.
They eventually returned to Russia together and started a familly.
--
At the outset of World War I, air force was strictly used for reconnaissance and coordination of artillery fire. Later, they were rearmed with steel flachettes and air-dropped bombs to attack ground targets.
You can imagine the effectiveness of those weapons. After some time, machine guns replaced them, which also enabled the aeroplanes to fight each other. My great-grandfather was never shot down, although he came close once, but managed to land successfully.
Nikita became an ace pilot and received the Order of the White Eagle and few other medals. I still have them at my home, along with the other decorations and awards of my other family members. If we ever get the chance, I can show you, if you'd like.
I already added a few to the collection myself. The most successful is my grandfather, who fought in the Patriotic war. He shot down the most enemy aircraft - incredible forty-seven!
But I digress, first there was the civil war.
--
The civil war is a somewhat dark passge in our family books - you see, Nikita actually fought for the Whites. 
The war was bloody and hard. There was no joy in it, as my grand-grandfather used to say. It was brother against brother. He was forced to shoot down many of his former colleagues and friends.
When it was finally over and the Whites lost, Nikita was pardoned. Possibly for his great skill and fame. He left the army soon afterwards - he was unable to continue serving after such a horrendous war. In his eyes, service lost meaning.
Now it is finally time for the greatest pilot in Syomin history, my grandfather, Aleksandr Syomin!
--
It was during the Great Patriotic War. At the beginning, most of our aircrft got destroyed before they had a chance to take off.
Whatever was left was crambled and used to defend Moscow. My grandfather flew air missions day and night, with little sleep and rest. When the enemy finally retreated, he told me he slept for three days straight to recover!
Aleksandr was flying the famous Lavochkin La-5 model. It was an incredible aeroplane. With its revolutionary air-cooled engine and two cannons, it was powerful enough to challenge even the feared German Messerschmitt.
My grandfather flew many sorties during the war and shot down by official accounts forty seven enemy aircraft, the most in our family history as well as sixth in total in all the Soviet Union.
He was made a Hero of the Soviet Union and received many medals. I added them at the lower shelf in our collection, right below my great-grandfather. Each family generation has its own shelf, mine is the lowest.
--
My father and your namesake, Grigory Syomin, was more of an engineer than a pilot. He worked in Mil - the aerospace manufacturer - and helped design and create most of their models.
He was also part of every test flight, so that still makes him a pilot in my eyes. I am very proud of him, every time I fly in Mil model, I always think of him.
And not only him, actually. When I'm piloting, hundreds of meters above the ground, in a fight with enemy gunship, I remmeber all my forefathers. I'd like to think I'm making them proud.
So, there you have it, I told you about Nikita, the first pilot, Aleksandr, the best pilot, Grigory, the designer pilot, and Valentin, yours truly, the young pilot. Thank you for listening to my family story, it's been a while since I told it to someone.
The pleasure is all mine.
You are very kind, comrade Lemontov. I knew I'd like you.
--
I'm sorry, perhaps another time?
No problem, comrade Lemontov.
--
I'm sorry, comrade Syomin, but can we get to other topics as well?
Of course, of course, we can return to this some other time. What else would you like to know about?
-- Syomin - Air forces

-- Kaplinsky - Introduction
The legendary Grigory Lemontov. Our paths have finally crossed. Captain Kaplinsky, at your service.
Greetings, comrade Kaplinsky. Are you the new commander of Spetsnaz?
Yes, comrade Lemontov, but not for long now that you are here. We're already getting you your uniform and equipment. You shall be back in the field in no time.
What do you have in mind?
You are probably a little rusted after seven years of prison. The boys are ready to train with you and help you get back in to shape.
Once we are done with the training, comrade Volkov is going to assign us our mission.

-- Frolov - Introduction
If my eyes do not deceive me, I see comrade Lemontov. It's good to have you back, comrade.
Comrade Frolov, good to see you. How are you?
The same old, same old. I am still the commander of our armoured forces, though there are not really any forces to speak of.
I long for the old days. We waged a hard war, but it carried meaning. It felt like we were achieving something, something nobody dared before us.
What happened with you after I was captured?
I was with comrade Volkov. We retreated with him to the mainland. Not everyone was so lucky.
When we got the island back, I returned here. Nowadays, I hadly ever go back to the mainland. I like it here.
It's calm and quiet most of the time, though the weather got even more cold, if you can believe it! But I am not giving up my sunglasses!
Because they bring you luck.
Your memory has no equal, Lemontov!
-- Frolov - Makariy Frolov
You said you don't go back home anymore?
Aye, I don't really have a reason to. My wife died five years ago. Cancer.
I'm sorry for your loss.
We lived separately the last few years, but it still hurt. Without her, there is no real reason to go back.
The last time I was in Russia, it was at her funeral. I never looked back ever since.
-- Frolov - Tank forces
What's the current situation with the tanks?
We have hardly any, that's the main issue. Very little heavy tanks and modest amount of light tanks and transports.
We are able to support infantry to a limited extent, but in a tank battle we would not stand a chance.
We have been getting more stuff in lately, though we are still far away from a battle ready state.
What is the main tank model?
Still the good old T80 with slight modifications. There is no new design in the works anyway. You can't improve what is already perfect. 
Can't argue with that. Any new recruits?
A good amount. I train them personally. It's a hard training, but if they can master the local terrain, they can fight anywhere.
Because of the treaty, they can't stay here, so we swap them around during the year.
-- Frolov - Exit conversation
It was good to see you again, comrade Frolov. Goodbye.
Goodbye, comrade Lemontov.

-- Postmaster - Introduction
Postmaster Belsky?
In person. What can I do for you, comrade?
I'm looking for information about politics and world affairs in the last seven years.
Hm, oddly specific, but I can oblige. What do you wish to know about?
-- Postmaster - Soviet Union
What's the situation back home?
Not good. The economy is stagnating, the political elite is corrupt and the socialist states and members of Warsaw pact are playing with the idea of secession.
What about the leadership?
There were a few in the last seven years. Comrade Brezhnev died in 1982, afterwards it was comrade Andropov, but he only lasted to 1984. Then there was a troika of comrades Ustinov, Gromyko and Chernenko. Comrade Ustinov died in 1985 and was replaced by comrade Mazurov. That's the current troika in power.
None of them have enough individual strength to rule alone and so they depend on each other. At the same time, they try to weaken the others so that they can gain an absolute power. The result is an ineffective rule and a lot squabbling.
I do not know how to fix the economy, but a draining war in Afghanistan and massive military spending do not help.
The seceding states is antoher matter. There were few demonstrations already in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Baltic states... The presence of the army restored order, but tension is in the air.
There will have to be a change in the next years, the situation is not maintainable. What this change is going to look like and whether it can be peaceful, I can't tell you. One thing is certain - hard times are ahead.
-- Postmaster - United States
How does the west look like?
The United States is as strong as ever. Although in recession for the first few years of the decade, now their economy is on sharp rise.
Ronald Reagan is the incumbent president since 1981. He took a hard stance against us - calling us an 'evil empire' and increasing the material support to our enemies.
They know we're in trouble and we cannot sustain the status quo for much longer. They will win in the long run without firinng a single shot.
-- Postmaster - Afghanistan
I keep hearing about Afghanistan. The war there is still ongoing?
It was supposed to be a one year affair at the longest. Now it has become a seven year ordeal with no end in sight. 
Although we captured all of the urban areas and the main roads, the mujahideen retreated to the mountains and waged a guerilla war. They received a substantial aid from abroad and the mountains provided them with cover.
We never managed to defeat them, it was impossible. Even leveling entire villages with helicopters did not diminish them. And so the war continued.
The was's been in a stalemate for years now. We spent a lot to achieve very little. I'm not sure what the current goal is, but even if we by some miracle managed to win, it would not have been worth it.
-- Postmaster -- Exit conversation
Thanks for all the information, I needed that.
No problem. Were you living under the rock for the past seven years of what?
You could say that. I just returned from captivity.
Wait, you are Grigory Lemontov. They told me you'd be returning today. It was a pleasure, comrade! If you ever need any sort of information, I am your man!
That is good to know. Take care, comrade Belsky.
Goodbye, comrade Lemontov!

-- Kuznetsov - Introduction
The hero has returned! I salute you, comrade Lemontov.
Comrade Kuznetsov, you haven't changed much. Still not an officer?
I am not suited to command people, comrade. I wouldn't take it seriously enough. I am much happier with my current position.
By your current position you mean the one you've kept for what, ten years?
My experinece only makes be better. So I am both happy and good at my job, a win-win situation. Did you come to hear about what's been going on around here?
Precisely.
Then ask away.
-- Kuznetsov - Kolguyev
Tell me about the end of the war, about the peace treaty.
After you were captured, they smashed the rest of our army. Some managed to retreat from the island, but many were taken prisoner. Not to mention all the equipment and vehicles.
In the end we managed to negotiate a somewhat favorable peace deal. We had to renounce our claims on Everon and reduce the Kolguyev garrison to one hundred men. In exchange, we received most of our prisoners back, with the exception of you. They also kept our equipment.
Everon was declared netural and the Americans also left it and returned to Malden. The peace treaty forbids us to attack Everon or Malden, otherwise hostilities will resume.
And that is the status quo.
-- Kuznetsov - Everon
Tell me about Everon.
After the war, Everon regained its independence. They tried to establish a democracy, but it wasn't easy. The rebel commander, Gaston Astier, had a sizeable following as well as number of armed men at his disposal. The first few months, whatever the government decided, they had to check with Gaston first. It felt like a military dictatorship in the making.
When Petain became president, he made a deal with Astier - he named him the commander of the militias, granting him official power over the whole military, in exchange for not getting involved in the politics from there on. It worked well for years.
Recently, there had been some trouble. The police chief, Daladier, will run for president in the next elections in a few months. Petain is getting old and he might not get the support he once enjoyed. If Daladier wins, Astier will not like it - he might get involved in politics again.
Police chief and militia commander - two armed institutions against each other - it might even boil over into a civil war. The next presidential elections will be very interesting and their outcome might shape the future of Everon for years to come.
-- Kuznetsov - Malden
Do we know anything about Malden?
Still an American stronghold. Their main training camp, heavily fortified and guarded. We don't know much beyond that. 
-- Kuznetsov - Exit the conversation
Thanks for the information, comrade Kuznetsov, it was helpful.
No problem. Remmeber, you can always count on me! And let me tell you - I missed you! Goodbye, comrade Lemontov!
Take care, comrade Kuznetsov.
