<b>28th January 1989</b> - Dearest Ekaterina,
<br><br>
I am wary. It's been two weeks today since I last received your reply. I hope you are your healty self. I hope there is nothing wrong and the letters were just misplaced or were delayed on the way here.
<br><br>
That is a plausible explanation, isn't it? I am a fool, getting anxious over nothing. Please forgive me, I simply long for your sweet words of reassurance. I shall arm myself with patience and await your response.
<br><br>
You should know we are back on Everon. Do news of this reach you in our homeland? After Kolguyev, it is an obvious course of action to take back the island as that's how this war started in the first place. Both wars in fact. Once we are victorious, that should be the end of the conflict. Afterwards, there will be a lot of talk about the terms of treaties and whatever else, but I am no longer needed by then. I shall be leaving the moment I am able.
<br><br>
I cannot wait to hold you in my arms again, Ekaterina. Our long separation did not diminish the flames in my heart, I feel like they're burning ever stronger.
<br><br>
Forever yours,<br>
Nikolay
