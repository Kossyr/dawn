STRM_35v01,"Your patience paid off, comrades. It is time for you to finally get in the best gunship the Red Army has to offer.",Syomin
STRM_35v02,"Behold the beauty of Kamov V-80!",Syomin
STRM_35v03,"Yes! Finally!",Koltsov
STRM_35v04,"We did it!",Ablomov
STRM_35v05,"Are we going on a mission, comrade Syomin? Preferably right now?",Koltsov
STRM_35v06,"Of course. It seems there might be a naval engagement off the coast of Kolguyev and we need to help.",Syomin
STRM_35v07,"Unfortunately, one of you has to stay here in reserve in case anything goes down on the island.\nWe are the only combat ready squadron in the area at the moment. Choose between yourselves.",Syomin
STRM_35v08,"Hm... Ippolit, I think it should be...",Ablomov
STRM_35v09,"Ippolit?!",Ablomov
STRM_35v10,"Sorry, man, I need to fly this thing right now or I lose it completely! The next vodka is on me, I promise!",Koltsov

STRM_35v11,"It might take hours before they come back. I should do something more useful than just standing around.",Ablomov
STRM_35v12,"I should check on the helicopter, make sure everything is in order.\nI would not mind a second look at that machine anyway.",Ablomov
STRM_35v13,"I also need to give my letter to the postmaster. And ask him about the lack of letters recently.",Ablomov

STRM_35v14,"I have a letter to send. Here.",Ablomov
STRM_35v15,"Another letter to Mother Russia, it shall be sent. Anything else?",postmaster
STRM_35v16,"Actually, yes. Have any new letters arrived recently?",Ablomov
STRM_35v17,"Some, not so many lately though. Nothing for you, comrade Ablomov, sorry.",postmaster
STRM_35v18,"I am expecting an important letter. You are certain not one came in?",ablomov
STRM_35v19,"Yes, I am, I have nothing for you. I mean, you've been getting letters from the same address for a few months now.\nWhat could possibly be so important in this umpteenth one?",postmaster
STRM_35v20,"Have you ever fallen in love?",Ablomov
STRM_35v21,"Hmph, no.",postmaster
STRM_35v22,"Then you wouldn't understand. I'll come by later.",Ablomov
STRM_35v23,"Be my guest.",postmaster

STRM_35v24,"Properly oiled.. the engines are clean... All ammunition is in place...",Ablomov
STRM_35v25,"Is the fuel tank only half full? It should have been tanked up this morning.",Ablomov
STRM_35v26,"Someone from logistics slacked again...",Ablomov

STRM_35v27,"My helicopter's fuel tank is only half full. There must have been a mistake.",Ablomov
STRM_35v28,"Hm? Oh, right, we did have some trouble with the cistern. It's possible some of the vehicles might be lower on fuel.",logistics
STRM_35v29,"Sounds like a problem to me.",Ablomov
STRM_35v30,"Well, you're the first one to complain since morning.",logistics
STRM_35v31,"I need it full in case of a long range flight.",Ablomov
STRM_35v32,"Sure, I get that, but I am not authorized to give you fuel. You need to get permission from Chernikov, my commanding officer.\nHe went on a walk to that chapel at the end of the road to the north.",logistics
STRM_35v33,"Then call him for me, will you?",Ablomov
STRM_35v34,"He didn't take his radio with him.",logistics
STRM_35v35,"You are kidding me, right?",Ablomov
STRM_35v36,"Do I look like I am? Why the long face, it's a pleasant walk. Or you can borrow one of the cars if you're in a hurry.",logistics

STRM_35v37,"What a joke. They fail to tank up my helicopter and I am the one to run around and demand they fix their fuck up.\nTowards the chapel, I guess.",Ablomov

STRM_35v38,"Comrade Chernikov I presume?",Ablomov
STRM_35v39,"You presume right. What do you need of me?",chernikov
STRM_35v40,"Ablomov, the air force. What are you even doing here, comrade?",Ablomov
STRM_35v41a,"This chapel is the northernmost point of the island.\nYou can see the vast ocean sprawling into the distance and the calm waves bring peace to my mind.",chernikov
STRM_35v41b,"It is a good place to think.",chernikov
STRM_35v42,"I guess I see your point.",Ablomov
STRM_35v43,"What do you need of me?",chernikov
STRM_35v44,"My fuel tank is only half full. I am in reserve and need it full in case of an emergency.",Ablomov
STRM_35v45,"I see. Well, that's not a problem. I'll call it in and you should be good to go.",chernikov
STRM_35v46,"Call it in? They told me you don't have the radio with you.",Ablomov
STRM_35v47a,"We are in the middle of a war and near the front lines. I like my peace, but that is just silly.",chernikov
STRM_35v47b,"Hm, seems like Kuznetsov is bored and in need of work.\nGet back to the airport, the fuel will be resolved.",chernikov

STRM_35v48,"I hate the guy.",Ablomov
