STRM_35v01,"Your patience paid off, comrades. It is time for you to finally get in the best gunship the Red Army has to offer.","",Syomin
STRM_35v02,"Behold, Kamov V-80!","",Syomin
STRM_35v03,"Yes! Finally!","",Koltsov
STRM_35v04,"We did it!","",Ablomov
STRM_35v05,"Are we going on a mission, comrade Syomin? Preferably right now?","",Koltsov
STRM_35v06,"Of course. It seems there might be a naval engagemtn off the coast of Kolguyev and we need to help.","",Syomin
STRM_35v07,"Unfortunately, one of you has to stay here in reserve in case anything goes down on the island. We are the only combat ready squadron on the island at the moment. Choose between yourselves.","",Syomin
STRM_35v08,"Hm... Ippolit, I think it should be...","",Ablomov
STRM_35v09,"Ippolit?!","",Ablomov
STRM_35v10,"Sorry, man, I need to fly this thing right now or I lose it completely! The next vodka is on me, I promise!","",Koltsov

STRM_35v11,"It might take hours before they come back. I should do something more useful than just standing around.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v12,"I should check on the helicopter, make sure everything is in order.\nI would not mind a second look at that machine anyway.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v13,"I also need to give my letter to the postmaster. And ask him about the lack of letters recently.","",Ablomov

STRM_35v14,"I have a letter to send. Here.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v15,"Another letter to Mother Russia, it shall be sent. Anything else?","",postmaster
STRM_35v16,"Actually, yes. Have any new letters arrived recently?","",Ablomov
STRM_35v17,"Some, not so many lately though. Nothing for you, comrade Ablomov, sorry.","",postmaster
STRM_35v18,"I am expecting an important letter. You are certain not one came in?","",ablomov
STRM_35v19,"Yes, I am, I have nothing for you. I mean, you've been getting letters from the same address for a few months now.\nWhat could possibly be so important in this umpteenth one?","",postmaster
STRM_35v20,"Have you ever fallen in love?","",Ablomov
STRM_35v21,"Hmph, no.","",postmaster
STRM_35v22,"Then you wouldn't understand. I'll come by later.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v23,"Be my guest.","",postmaster

STRM_35v24,"Properly oiled.. the engines are clean... All ammunition is in place...","",Ablomov
STRM_35v25,"Hm... is the fuel tank only half full? It should have been filled fully this morning","",Ablomov
STRM_35v26,"Someone from logistics slacked again...","",Ablomov

STRM_35v27,"My helicopter's fuel tank is only half full. There must have been a mistake.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v28,"Oh, right, we did have some trouble with the cistern. It's possible some of the vehicles might be lower on fuel.","",logistics
STRM_35v29,"Sounds like a problem to me.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v30,"Well, you're the first one to complain since morning.","',logistics
STRM_35v31,"I need it full in case of a long range flight.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v32,"Sure, I get that, but I am not authorized to give you fuel. You need to get permission from Borisov, my commanding officer.\nHe went on a walk to that chapel at the end of the road to the north and he did not take his radio with him.","",logistics
STRM_35v33,"You are kidding me, right?","",Ablomov
STRM_35v34,"Do I look like I am? Why the long face, it's a nice walk. Or you can borrow one of the cars if you're in a hurry.\nBut you're in reserve, so you ar e not.","",logistics

STRM_35v35,"What a joke. They fail to fill my fuel tank and I am the one to run around and demand they fix their fuck up. Towards the chapel, I guess.","",Ablomov

STRM_35v36,"Comrade Borisov I presume?","",Ablomov
STRM_35v37,"You presume right. What do you need of me?","",Borisov
STRM_35v38,"Ablomov, air force. What are you even doing here, comrade?","",Ablomov
STRM_35v39,"This chapel is the northernmost point of the island. You can see the vast ocean sprawling into the distance and the calm waves bring peace to my mind. \nA good place to think.","",Borisov
STRM_35v40,"I guess I see your point.","",Ablomov
STRM_33v41,"What do you need of me?","",Borisov
STRM_35v42,"My fuel tank is only half full. I am in reserve and need it full in case of an emergency.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v43,"I see. Well, that's not a problem. I'll call it in and you should be good to go.","",Borisov
STRM_35v44,"Call it in? They told me you don't have the radio with you.","",Ablomov
STRM_35v45,"We are in the middle of a war and near the front lines. I like my calm, but that is just silly. Get back to the airport, the fuel will be resolved.","",Borisov

STRM_35v46,"I hate the guy.","",Ablomov
