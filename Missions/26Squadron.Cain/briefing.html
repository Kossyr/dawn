<b>14th December 1987</b> - Dearest Ekaterina,
<br><br>
I can't believe what I am about to write. I was promoted to attack squadron! Finally, my long held dream is finally coming true! We flew with Ippolit yesterday and were close when an enemy made a breakthrough so we were sent in. We saved an entire squad and destroyed enemy armour - then swept the squad up and got them to the hospital in time. You should have seen those cheers when we got to the barracks!
<br><br>
Although it does pain me at the same time - I will now be on the front lines in the thick of the fighting. It will be dangerous, but this is what I always wanted. I hope you can forgive me for I aim to fulfill my promise - I will return to you the first chance I get. For now, I will fight for our country so that this conflict is resolved as soon as possible. Then we can finally be together.
<br><br>
I'll write to you soon. We're going on our first mission. I know you wish me luck - and I thank you. I always keep the locket with your photo in my cockpit. Now the cockpit does change, but your memento does not. You are still with me up there in the skies.
<br><br>
Forever yours,<br>
Nikolay
